<h1>Organizing Using Categories</h1>

<p>The major tool for organizing your computers <a href="../overview/key_concepts.html#resources">resources</a>
 in <span style="x-condition: READER;">Omea Reader</span><span style="x-condition: PRO;">Omea
 Pro</span> is called <strong>Categories</strong>. It’s one of several
 ways to organize your resources, but since other ways really revolve around
 this one, let’s do an overview of Categories and understand what they
 are and how they work.</p>

<h2>The Problem with Windows</h2>

<p>Have you ever noticed how Windows forces you to file things according
 to <em>its</em> requirements rather than yours? You have to conform to
 a hierarchical filing model regardless of whether or not it’s the best
 approach for the kind of work you do. Furthermore, the Windows file system
 doesn't enable you to organize any resources other than files. If you
 want to file something in more than one place, you end up with multiple
 copies which can end up out of sync.</p>

<div style="x-condition: PRO;">
<h3>The Problem with Programs</h3>

<p>For e-mail messages, instant message conversations, newsgroup articles,
 feeds, etc. you have to use some application program, and usually a <em>different</em>
 program for each type of resource. You can organize each resource type
 inside the relevant program, but that’s all. You can’t organize files
 with your e-mail program, or instant messages with your feed reader, and
 in no case can you really organize different types of resources around
 some context that’s meaningful to <em>you</em>, and that relates to your
 daily activities. Nor is there any way you can file the <em>same</em>
 resource in more than one place (without creating a copy of it, which
 can easily get out of sync if it is modified!)</p>

<p>For example, suppose you have a project <em>&quot;Project ABC&quot;</em>.
 For this project you have several activities: communicating with suppliers,
 keeping track of work progress of team members, and updating your boss.
 Until now, there has been no way that you could file all the documents,
 e-mail messages, instant messages, contacts, tasks, etc. that you need
 to work on Project ABC and its various activities in one place where you
 can access any of them fast when you need them. If there are some resources
 that relate to both your supplier management <em>and</em> your team management
 activities, you could not file the same resource under both activities
 and access it from the context of either.</p>
</div>

<div style="x-condition: READER;">
<h3>The Problem with Programs</h3>

<p>Newsgroup articles, web pages, and syndicated feeds require you to use
 some application program, and usually a <em>different</em> program for
 each type of resource. You can usually organize each resource type inside
 the relevant program, but that’s all. You can’t organize web pages with
 your newsgroup reader program, or feed postings with your web browser,
 and in no case can you really organize different types of resources around
 some context that’s meaningful to <em>you</em>, and that relates to your
 daily activities. Nor is there any way you can file the <em>same</em>
 resource in more than one place without creating a copy.)</p>

<p>For example, suppose you have a project <em>&quot;Project ABC&quot;</em>.
 For this project you have several activities: researching web sites for
 a whitepaper, monitoring an RSS feed, and moderating a newsgroup. Until
 now, there has been no way that you could file all the different kinds
 of resources you need to work on Project ABC and its various activities
 in one place where you can access any of them fast when you need them.
 If there are some web pages that relate to both your whitepaper research
 <em>and</em> your newsgroup moderator activities, you could not file the
 same resource under both activities and access it from the context of
 either.</p>

<h3>How <span style="x-condition: READER;">Omea Reader</span><span style="x-condition: PRO;">Omea
 Pro</span> is Different</h3>

<p>With <span style="x-condition: READER;">Omea Reader</span><span style="x-condition: PRO;">Omea
 Pro</span> you can create any kind of filing system you want... hierarchical,
 non-hierarchical, or a little of both. Your filing system can be as simple
 or as complex as you wish. It can contain any type of resource <span style="x-condition: READER;">Omea
 Reader</span><span style="x-condition: PRO;">Omea Pro</span><span style="x-condition: PRO;">
 supports... files, e-mail messages, news articles, feed postings, etc.</span><span
 style="x-condition: READER;"> supports.</span> <span style="x-condition: PRO;">It
 doesn't matter whether a resource is a file stored somewhere in the Windows
 file system or attached to an e-mail message in Outlook, or if it is actually
 an e-mail message stored by MS Outlook, or even a Web page bookmarked
 in the Mozilla browser. You can file it in your filing system anywhere,
 in as many places as you need.</span> <span style="x-condition: READER;">It

<h2>Important Concepts for Categories</h2>

<h3>What are Categories?</h3>

<p>Categories are the basis for your filing system in <span style="x-condition: READER;">Omea
 Reader</span><span style="x-condition: PRO;">Omea Pro</span>. Technically,
 a Category is just a label with which you can associate as many resources
 as you want. It might help to think of Categories like the &quot;pigeonholes&quot;
 in an antique roll-top desk. You can stuff anything you want into one:
 envelopes, documents, cheques, etc. You can then retrieve any item later.
 Unlike the old desk, with <span style="x-condition: READER;">Omea Reader</span><span
 style="x-condition: PRO;">Omea Pro</span> you can stuff the same thing
 into several different pigeonholes (it’s still just one thing...no copies!).
 And if you forget where you put something, you can quickly find it using
 the built-in search engine.</p>

<h3>What are Single-resource Categories and Why are They Different?</h3>

<p><em style="font-style: italic;">Single-resource Categories</em> are
 essentially the same as any other Categories. The only differences are:</p>

<ul>

	<li class=omguy>Single-resource Categories only contain one type
 of resource. For example, E-mail Categories contain only e-mail messages.</li>

	<li class=omguy>Single-resource Categories only show up when you
 are working in the main window tab for the relevant resource type. For
 example, E-mail Categories only appear when you have selected the E-mail
 tab in the main window.</li>
</ul>

</ul>
</div>

<h1>Working with Categories</h1>

<p>This section explains how to do various tasks related to creating and
 managing Categories.</p>

<a name=viewing></a>

<h2>Viewing Categories</h2>

<p>You can view your Categories in the <em>Categories</em> folder of the
 <em>Views and Categories</em> pane. <!-- TO DO: link to UI tour section on this pane! -->
	If this pane is not visible, click the <strong>Views and Categories</strong>
 button on the pane selector bar (left-hand side of the main window) or press the shortcut which you have assigned to the shortcut using <a href="#assignhotkeystocategories"><em>Category Hotkeys plugin</em></a>.</p>

<h3>Viewing Single-resource Categories</h3>

<p>Your <a href="#singleresource">single-resource Categories</a> appear
 in a folder named <em>&lt;resource-type&gt;</em> Categories in the Views
 and Categories pane when the tab for the relevant resource type is selected
 in the main window. For example, a Category that contains only web pages
 appears under a folder named &quot;Web Bookmark Categories&quot; when
 you are working in the Web tab of the main window. If no single-resource
 categories are defined, the folder for resource-specific Categories does
 not appear.</p>

<div class=proc>
<p class=procHead>To view single-resource Categories:</p>

<ol>

	<li class=kadov-p>Select the relevant tab in the main window (<strong>Web</strong>,
 for example).</li>

	<li class=kadov-p>If the <strong>Views and Categories</strong> pane is not
 visible, show it by clicking the button of the same name on the pane selector
 bar.</li>

	<li class=kadov-p>Expand the <em>&lt;resource-type&gt;</em> Categories
 folder in the <strong>Views and Categories</strong> pane. For example, in the <strong>Web</strong> tab,
 select the &quot;<strong>Web Bookmark Categories</strong>&quot; folder if you have Categories
 that contain only Web pages.</li>
</ol>
</div>

<a name=new></a>

<h2>Creating New Categories</h2>

<p>You can create new Categories, including single-resource Categories
 using either:</p>

<ul>

	<li class=kadov-p>Main menu: <strong>File | New | Category</strong>
 or...</li>

	<li class=kadov-p>Assign Categories dialog: <strong>New</strong> button</li>

	<li class=kadov-p>Categories folder: context menu</li>
    <li class=kadov-p><strong>Ctrl+Y</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>The latter is probably the one you will prefer to use. Here is the procedure
 step-by-step.</p>

<div class=proc>
<p class=procHead>To create a new Category:</p>
<ol>

	<li class=kadov-p>If you want the Category to belong to a Workspace
 other than <em>All</em>, go to the desired Workspace by clicking its
 selector on the <em>Workspaces</em> selector bar.</li>

	<li class=kadov-p>Show the <em>Views and Categories</em> pane if it
 is not visible.</li>

	<li style="padding-bottom: 16px;"
		class=kadov-p>
	Right-click on the <em>Categories</em> folder and choose <strong>New
 Category</strong> on the context menu. The <em>Create New Category</em>
 dialog appears. </li>

	<p><img src="../images/sshots/dialogs/shared/new_category_dialog.png" width="300" height="265" alt="New Category dialog"></p>
	<p class="caption">New Category dialog</p>
	<li class="kadov-p">Type a name for the new category in the <em>Name</em> field.</li>
	<li class="kadov-p">Specify the type of resource the new Category should contain by selecting from the drop-down list of resource types. The default is <em>All Resources</em>, which you will probably want to use for most Categories. To create a single-resource Category, select on of the other items in the list (See Tip below).</li>
	<li class="kadov-p">Select where to place the new Category:	  </li>
	<ul>
	  <li class=kadov-p>If this is your first Category, select the Categories folder (as in picture above).</li>
	  <li class=kadov-p>If you have other Categories defined, select the Categories folder to create the new Category on the same level.</li>
	  <p><img src="../images/sshots/dialogs/shared/new_category_dialog_folder.png" alt="New Category dialog (Categories folder is selected) " width="300" height="356"></p>
	  <p class="caption">New Category dialog. The new category will be created in Categories folder (which is currently selected)</p>
	  <li class=kadov-p>If you have other Categories defined and you want to create a <em>hierarchy</em> in which the new Category is a child (or -Category) of an existing Category, select the Category you want as the parent of the new Category.</li>
	  <p><img src="../images/sshots/dialogs/shared/new_category_dialog_hierarc.png" width="300" height="356"></p>
	  <p class="caption">New Category dialog. The new category will be a subcategory of &#8220;Omea&#8221;</p>
	  <li class=kadov-p>If you have created a category for a single resource type, select the folder for that type that automatically appears in the listing of Categories.</li>
	  </ul>
	</ol>
 <div class=tip>
        <div class=tipImg
	style="/*begin!kadov{{*/ x-right: 747px; x-bottom: 776px; /*}}end!kadov*/ ">
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
        </div>
        <p class=tip>Unless the tab for the resource type of a new single-resource Category is active in the main window, it may appear that the new Category was not created. For example, if you are focused on Feeds and create a single-resource Category for news articles, you should switch to the News tab, where you will see the new Category in the Views and Categories pane.</p>
    </div>
</div>
<div style="x-condition: PRO;">
<a name=catsfromlists></a>

<h3>Creating Categories from Internet Mailing Lists</h3>

<p>When this option is checked, Omea detects when incoming e-mail messages were sent from some Internet mailing list (for example, the groups at groups.yahoo.com) and creates a Category for each mailing list as messages from it arrive. Future messages from the same mailing list are then automatically filed in the relevant Category. Categories
 are created in the <em>All</em> Workspace.</p>

<div class=proc>
<p class=procHead>To auto-create Categories from Internet mailing lists:</p>

<ol>

	<li class=kadov-p>On the main menu, choose <strong>Tools | Options.</strong></li>

	<li class=kadov-p>In the Options dialog, choose <strong>MS Outlook: Outlook Address Books</strong>.</li>

	<li class=kadov-p>Check the box: <strong>Create Categories from Internet mailing lists</strong>. </li>
</ol>
</div>
</div>
<a name=assignhotkeystocategories></a>
<h2>Installing Category Hotkeys Plugin and Assigning Hotkeys for the Categories</h2>
<p>To ease your work with Categories, you can download and install the plugin for assigning hotkeys to your Categories (see <a href="../reference/plugins.html">Options: Plugins</a>). The plugin is available at Omea's web site <a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/omea/plugins/index.html">plugins page</a>. </p>
<h3>Plugin Installation</h3>
<p>To install the plugin, unpack it to the Omea installation directory, go to
    <strong>Tools | Options | Omea | Plugins</strong>, click on &#8220;<strong>Add...</strong>&#8221; and select the <strong>CategoryHotkeys.dll</strong> file. Then restart Omea.</p>
<h3>Assigning Hotkeys to Categories</h3>
<p>After the plugin is installed, and you have created some Categories, you can assign the hotkeys for each category. The hotkeys will allow you to assign the category to the selected resources and to remove the category from the selected resources. </p>

<p>To assign a hotkey for the Category, right-click any category and select <strong>Assign Hotkeys&#8230;</strong> In the window which opens press or type the key(s) you would like to use to assign the selected Category and click
    <strong>OK</strong> to save the hotkey.</p>
<a name=renaming></a>
<h2>Renaming a Category</h2>

<p>Once you have created a Category, you can rename it any time. The updated
 name is displayed in all Workspaces where the Category is accessible,
 and the Category contains all the same resources it contained before the
 name change.</p>

<p>You can rename a Category using the same techniques available in Windows
 Explorer to rename a file:</p>

<ul>

	<li class=kadov-p>In the <strong>Views and Categories</strong> pane, select the Category;
 then click it to trigger in-place renaming.</li>

	<li class=kadov-p>Right-click the Category and choose <strong>Rename
 Category</strong> on the context menu.</li>
    <li class=kadov-p>Press <strong>F2</strong> </li>
</ul>

<a name=removing></a>

<h2>Removing a Category</h2>

<p>Categories need not be permanent fixtures. As things change with your
 day to day activities, you may find some Category is no longer relevant
 or useful. In that case, you can remove it from Omea.</p>

<p>When you remove a Category, you do <em>not</em> remove or delete from
 disk any of the resources it contained. You will still be able to find
 the resources using Search, and access the resources from Omea.</p>

<div class=proc>
<p class=procHead>To remove a Category:</p>

<ol>

	<li class=kadov-p>Select the Category in the <strong>Views and Categories</strong> pane.</li>

	<li class=kadov-p>Press the <strong>Delete (Del)</strong> key or right-click and select <strong>Delete</strong>.</li>
</ol>
</div>

<a name=filing></a>

<h2>Filing Resources in Categories</h2>

<p>Once you have your filing system of Categories in place, you will want
 to file various resources into them. There are three ways to file resources
 in Categories:</p>

<ol>

	<li class=kadov-p>Drag-and-drop (resources to a Category or Category to the resources) </li>

	<li class=kadov-p>Links panel</li>

	<li class=kadov-p>Resource List context menu (right-click the selected items in the <strong>Items List</strong>) </li>
    <li class=kadov-p>Press <strong>Ctrl+Y</strong> and then select the desired Category in the <strong>Assign Categories</strong> dialog. </li>
</ol>

<h3>Drag-and-drop</h3>

<p>Use two types of drag and drop to associate your resources with Categories:</p>
<ol>
  <li>You can drag one or more selected resources from the <strong>Items List</strong> and
       drop your selection onto any existing Category. If you want to file the
       same resource(s) in more than one Category, repeat the drag-and-drop for
       each Category where you want to file it/them. For example, you can drag
       a Newsgroup article from the list of articles and drop it into any Category,
       repeating the action to file the same article in multiple Categories.<br>
      In some cases, you may be able to drag resources from a pane in the
left-hand Navigation panel. For example, you can drag one or more items
from the <strong>Correspondents</strong> pane into a Category.</li>
  <li>Drag a Category in the <strong>Views and Categories</strong> pane,  drop it to the selected resource in the <strong>Items List</strong>. Please note that it works only for one item in the <strong>Items List</strong>. </li>
</ol>
<h3>Links Panel</h3>

<p>When the <a href="organizing_using_links.html">Links panel</a> is open
 in the <strong>Links and Actions</strong> pane, you can click <strong>Assign Categories</strong>
 to pop up a dialog in which you can file the currently selected resource
 in one or multiple Categories.</p>
 <div class=tip>
        <div class=tipImg
	style="/*begin!kadov{{*/ x-right: 747px; x-bottom: 776px; /*}}end!kadov*/ ">
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
        </div>
        <p class=tip><span class="tip1">You can use the <strong>New</strong> button in the <strong>Assign Categories</strong> dialog to create a new Category &quot;on the fly&quot;.</span></p>
  </div>

 <h3>Resource List Context Menu</h3>

<p>The context menu of each resource in the main window’s Resource List
 contains an item <em>Assign Category.</em> In the resulting dialog you
 can select one or more Categories in which to file the selected resource.
 For example, in the Resource List for web pages, right-click on any listed
 web page and choose <strong>Assign Category</strong>. This action is applied to all selected resources.
</p>
<a name=subcategories></a>
<h2>Viewing the Contents of Subcategories</h2>
<p>Suppose  you have a nested hierarchy of Categories which include a number of subcategories. To view the contents of subcategories you usually need to select the desired subcategory in the list of Categories so that the contents of subcategories appears in the <strong>Items List</strong>. </p>
<p>Now you can view  items of a Category and all items of subcategories which it contains all at once. Just select the desired Category (which contains subcategories), right-click it and select <strong>Show Contents of Subcategories</strong>. The items which the subcategories contain, appear in the <strong>Items List</strong> along with the items which the top-level Category contains. </p>
<p class="caption"><img src="../images/sshots/shared/categories_tree1.png" width="744" height="592" alt="Items List shows all items which the subcategories contain"></p>
<p class="caption">Now the Items List shows all items which the subcategories contain </p>
<a name=categorizingwebpages></a>
<h2>Categorizing Web Pages in Internet Explorer<sup>&copy;</sup>, Mozilla<sup>&copy;</sup> and Firefox<sup>&copy;</sup></h2>
<p>Now you can assign Categories to the web pages you browse using such browsers as Internet Explorer<sup>&copy;</sup>, Mozilla<sup>&copy;</sup> and Firefox<sup>&copy;</sup>. After the plugins are installed (the plugins are installed when you install  Omea), and  Omea toolbar appears in browsers, click the <strong>Annotate and Categorize</strong> button  on this toolbar. In the Annotate Bookmark window which opens, type the bookmark name and annotation and select one of the previously created Categories. </p>
