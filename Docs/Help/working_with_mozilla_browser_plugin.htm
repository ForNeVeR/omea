<h1>Working with the Mozilla&copy; Browser  Plugin</h1>

<p>This topic covers description of possibilities of Omea Connector plugin  which works with such Internet Browses as Mozilla&copy; and Mozilla&copy;. Once  you have installed Omea Connector  plugin, you will be able to:</p>
<ul>
  <li> subscribe to RSS and ATOM feeds, </li>
  <li>create Clippings (excerpts of the web pages or documents on the web), </li>
  <li>annotate and categorize web pages</li>
  </ul>
<p>without need to switch to Omea and do it both when Omea is running and  it is turned off. </p>

<h2>Installing Omea Connector Plugin</h2>
<p>Omea Connector Plugin is compatible with Mozilla&copy; and Mozilla&copy; Internet Browsers. The installation procedure for these two browsers is a little bit different. </p>
<p>Omea Connector plugin is included in the distribution of Omea and is installed in the same file folder where Omea is. So</p>
<div class="proc">
  <p class="procHead">To install the Omea Connector plugin into Mozilla&copy;: <o1>
  <ol>
    <li>Launch <strong>Mozilla</strong>&copy; browser.</li>
    <li>From the <strong>File</strong> menu, select <strong>Open File</strong>.<br>
      In the window which appears, navigate to Omea's installation folder, select the file named<strong> omeaconnector.xpi</strong> and click <strong>Open</strong>.</li>
    <li>In the <strong>Software Installation</strong> window which appears, click <strong>Install</strong>.<br>
      The plugin will be installed and the <strong>Alert</strong> window opens saying that the Omea Connector installation was successful.</li>
    <li>Click <strong>OK</strong> in the <strong>Alert</strong> window and <strong>OK</strong> in the <strong>Software Installation</strong> window and restart Mozilla&copy; so that your changes could take effect.</li>
    </ol>
  </div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="proc">
<p class="procHead">To install the Omea Connector plugin to Mozilla&copy;:</p>
   <ol>
   <li>Launch Mozilla&copy;.</li>
    <li>From the <strong>File</strong> menu, select <strong>Open File</strong>.<br>
      In the window which appears, navigate to Omea's installation folder, select  the file named <strong>omeaconnector.xpi</strong> and click <strong>Open</strong>.</li>
    <li>In the <strong>Software Installation</strong> window, click <strong>Install Now</strong>.<br>
      The <strong>Extensions </strong>window opens with the list of plugins installed in Mozilla&copy;.
    <li/>
    Close the <strong>Extensions</strong> window and restart the browser so that your changes could take effect.
   </ol>
</div>
<h2>Updating the Omea Connector Plugin</h2>
<p>To update the plugin, download the latest version of Omea and repeat the procedure described above. You don't need to uninstall the plugin, and install it again to update it. </p>
<h2>Subscribing to RSS and ATOM Feeds from within Mozilla&copy; Browsers </h2>
<p>Now you can subscribe to RSS and ATOM feeds right from Mozilla browsers without need to copy the URL and launch the Omea's <strong>Subscribe to Feed </strong>wizard. You have two options for creating the feeds subscription:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Subscribe to RSS or ATOM feed for the page that is currently opened
  <li/>
  Create the feed subscription from the link on the web page: when you navigate to some link of the web page opened in the browser (for example, in the body of the page), you can subscribe to a feed which it may represent.
</ul>
<p>The procedure of subscribing to the feeds is the same both for Mozilla&copy; and  Firefox&copy;:</p>
<div class="proc">
  <ol>
    <li>Launch Mozilla&copy; or Mozilla&copy; and navigate to some page.</li>
    <li>Do one of the following:
      <ul>
        <li> From the <strong>Tools</strong> menu, select <strong>Omea Connector &gt; Subscribe to RSS/ATOM Feed for This Page</strong></li>
        <li> Click <strong>Subscribe to Feed</strong> button on the Omea toolbar.</li>
        <li> Right-click the page and in the shortcut menu, select <strong>Subscribe to Feed for This Page in Omea</strong></li>
      </ul>
    </ol>
  <p>If Omea is running, the <strong>Subscribe to Feed</strong> wizard opens. The feed URL appears in the feed address field. Follow the wizard instructions (for example, type the feed name, select the feed type (RSS or ATOM) if necessary, select the feed you want to subscribe to if the page contains several feeds, and the feed group you want to add your feed to) to subscribe to the feed. </p>
  <p>If Omea is not running, the <strong>Subscribe to Feed</strong> wizard appears next time you start Omea.</p>
</div>
<p>If the link on the web page represents a feed, you can subscribe to this feed using Omea Connector plugin:</p>
<div class="proc">
  <ol>
    <li>Launch Mozilla&copy; or Mozilla&copy; and navigate to some page.</li>
    <li>Right-click the link on the web page which represents the feed and on the shortcut menu, select <strong>Create Omea Feed Subscription from Link</strong>.
  </ol>
  <p>In the <strong>Subscribe to Feed</strong> wizard the feed URL appears in the feed address field. Follow the wizard instructions to subscribe to the feed. </p>
  <p>If Omea is not running, the <strong>Subscribe to Feed</strong> wizard appears next time you start Omea. </p>
  </div>
<h2>Creating a Clipping</h2>
<p>Clipping in general is an excerpt of text from any textual resource which can be used for the later reference. In terms of Omea Connector, Clipping is a piece of the web page content. Clippings themselves
 are a type of resource, and you can organize and search them in the same
 ways as other types you work with in <span style="x-condition: READER;">Omea Reader</span> <span style="x-condition: PRO;">Omea Pro</span>.</p>
<p>You have two options for creating Clippings using Omea Connector  plugin:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>create</strong> the Clipping and <strong>edit</strong> its name and type some annotation for the Clipping.</li>
  <li><strong>create</strong> the Clipping from the selection and <strong>save</strong> the Clipping. In this case you don't have the possibility to edit the Clipping name and type some annotation. </li>
</ul>
<div class="proc">
  <p class="procHead">To create a Clipping from the selection of the web page:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Launch Mozilla&copy; or Mozilla&copy; and navigate to some page.</li>
    <li>Locate and select the text you want to clip and do one of the following:
      <ul>
        <li>From the <strong>Tools</strong> menu, select <strong>Omea Connector</strong> and then select either<strong> Create and Edit Clipping</strong> or <strong>Create and Save Clipping</strong>. </li>
        <li> Click either <strong>Clip and Save</strong> or <strong>Clip and Edit</strong> button on Omea toolbar. </li>
        </ul>
    <li>Depending on which command you have selected  Omea
will behave the Clippings differently:
      <ul>
        <li>If you have selected the <strong>Clip and Edit</strong>   or <strong>Create and Edit Clipping</strong>, the <strong>New Clipping</strong> window appears.
          <ul>
            <li>Type the  Clipping name and annotation and click <strong>Save and Close</strong>. <br>
                The Clipping  appears in the <strong>Item Viewer</strong> of the selected resource tab in Omea. The title of the web page from which you have created a Clipping becomes the Clipping name (if you didn't edit it). The web page link is placed under the Clipping text.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>If you have selected the <strong>Clip and Save</strong>, the Clipping will be saved in Omea and appears in the <strong>Clippings</strong> View of the <strong>Views and Categories</strong> pane when the <strong>All Resource</strong> tab is selected.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    </ol>
  <div class="note">
    <div class="noteImg"></div>
  	<p class="note">You can always access and view your Clippings in <strong>Clippings</strong> View of <strong>All Resources</strong> tab.</p>
  </div>

  <p>If Omea is not running, Clippings will be created next time you start Omea:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>If you used <strong>Clip and Save</strong> command, the Clippings appear in the <strong>Clippings</strong> View of <strong>All Resources</strong> tab. </li>
    <li>If you used  <strong>Clip and Edit</strong> command, the <strong>New Clipping</strong> window opens. <br>
      In this window you can edit the Clipping name and type its annotation. </li>
  </ul>
</div>

<h2>Annotating the Web Page</h2>
<p>With  Omea Connector  you can create the textual notes for the web pages. These notes like Clippings become a resource in Omea which is searchable and you can view them in the <strong>Annotated</strong> View of the <strong>Views and Categories</strong> pane. </p>
<div class="proc">
  <p class="procHead">To annotate the web page :</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Launch Mozilla&copy; or Mozilla&copy; and navigate to some page.</li>
    <li>Do one of the following:
      <ul>
        <li>From the <strong>Tools</strong> menu, select <strong>Annotate This Page</strong>. </li>
        <li>Click <strong>Annotate and Categorize</strong> on Omea toolbar.</li>
        <li>Right-click the web page or the link and on the shortcut menu, select <strong>Annotate This Page. </strong></li>
        </ul>
    </ol>
  <p>If Omea is started, the <strong>Edit Annotation</strong> window opens. Otherwise, you will be able to annotate the web page next time you start Omea. </p>
</div>
<h2>Customizing Omea Connector Options </h2>
<p>You can adjust such options as storing unprocessed requests and starting Omea when you use Omea Connector options while Omea is not running.</p>

<div class="proc">
<p class="procHead"> To configure these options in Mozilla&copy;: </p>
<ol>
  <li>Do one of the following:
    <ul>
      <li>From the <strong>Tools</strong> menu, select <strong>Omea Connector</strong>, and then select <strong>Options?</strong> <br>
            <strong>Omea Connector Options</strong> dialog opens. </li>
      <li>From the <strong>Edit</strong> menu, select <strong>Preferences</strong>. <br>
  The <strong>Preferences</strong> dialog opens.
    <ul>
      <li> Click the <strong>JetBrains Plugins</strong> category. (If no subcategories are visible, double click the category name to expand it.)<br>
        Omea Connector options appear in the right part of the <strong>Preferences</strong> window.</li>
    </ul>
      </li>
      </ul>
  </li>
      <li>Change  the options available under the <strong>Store requests for later processing </strong>  or select the <strong>Start Omea and retry request</strong>. </li>
    </ol>
<div class="note">
  <div class="noteImg"></div>
  	<p class="note">If Mozilla plugin is not installed, all Mozilla plugin options and actions  are not available.</p>
  </div>
  <p class="procHead"> To configure these options in  Firefox&copy;:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Do one of the following:
      <ul>
        <li> from the <strong>Tools</strong> menu, select <strong>Omea Connector</strong>, and then select <strong>Options?</strong> <br>
          <strong>Omea Connector Options</strong> dialog opens.</li>
        <li>from the <strong>Tools</strong> menu, select <strong>Extensions</strong>, select <strong>Omea Connector extension</strong> and click <strong>Options.</strong></li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    <li>In the Omea Connector Options window which opens, change  the options available under the <strong>Store requests for later processing </strong> or select the <strong>Start Omea and retry request</strong>.</li>
  </ol>
  Depending on the option you have selected, your requests (subscribing to feed, annotating the web page, creating Clipping) will be either stored, or Omea will be started up immediately once you have tried to perform some Omea plugin action.</div>
