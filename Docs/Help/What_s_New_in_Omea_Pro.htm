<ul>
  <li> Options: <strong>Mark all read on exit</strong> and <strong>Mark all read on Leave</strong> for a newsgroup</li>
  <li> News server option in the Posting tab: <strong>On Send, put articles in Outbox rather than post immediately</strong>.

  <li> New option for a feed &#8220;<strong>Accept equal posts</strong>&#8221;. We use several techniques for dealing with posts identical to previously posted in the case of e.g. the change of RSS engine.

    <ul>
      <li> Single form was split into several tabs</li>
      <li> Date controls were redesigned so that they are usable both from keyboard, mouse and stick (for tablets)</li>

    As an example of usage &#8220;highlight all news articles which nobody has answered to yet&#8221;</li>
  <li>View <strong>Next Week</strong> for <strong>Tasks</strong></li>
  <li>A very special condition: &#8220;Contact has correspondence&#8221;. Condition is true for those contacts which have at least one related news article or feed post, including those which are deleted and may be found in the <strong>Deleted Resources</strong> View</li>
  <li>Expiration rules now may be configured so that they do not touch categorized resources as well</li>
