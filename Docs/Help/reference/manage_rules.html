   <h1>Rules Manager Dialog</h1>
   <p>Rules help you to automate the management your computer&#146;s
   resources by defining what should be done with some resource(s) if some
   defined condition(s) is met. Rules in <span style="x-condition: READER;">
	Omea Reader</span><span style="x-condition: PRO;">Omea Pro</span> work very much
	like rules you may have encountered in MS Outlook<span style="x-condition: Pro;">, except that in <span style="x-condition: READER;">Omea Reader</span>
	<span style="x-condition: PRO;">Omea Pro</span>, you can define rules for much more than just e-mail.</span></p>

   <p>The<strong> Rules Manager</strong> dialog enables you to create new rules, and edit or
   remove existing rules. This topic explains the way the dialog works.</p>
   <p>You can access this dialog from the <strong>Tools</strong> menu, <strong>Manage Rules</strong> and select one of the rules types from the <strong>Manage Rules</strong> submenu. </p>
   <div style="float: left; margin-right: 24px;">

	<p class="caption">The Rules Manager dialog (some Action Rules are already defined) </p>
  </div>

   <h2>Dialog Components</h2>

   <h3>Available Rules List</h3>
   <p>This list shows the names of all the Rules currently defined in
	<span style="x-condition: READER;">Omea Reader</span><span style="x-condition: PRO;">Omea Pro</span>.
   The list is empty by default... that is, there are no pre-defined Rules.</p>

   <p>Each Rule name has a checkbox beside it. When the box is checked, the Rule
   is active, meaning <span style="x-condition: READER;">Omea Reader</span><span style="x-condition: PRO;">Omea Pro</span>
	will process it for all types of resources that  may be specified in the Rule.
	When the box is unchecked, <span style="x-condition: READER;">Omea Reader</span><span style="x-condition: PRO;">Omea Pro</span>
	will not  process the Rule.</p>

	<div class="tip">
	    <p class="tip1" style="padding-bottom: 10px;">Rules are processed in the order they appear (top to bottom) in the list.</p>
  </div>

   <h2>Tabs of the Rules Manager Dialog</h2>
   <p>Now the Rules Manager dialog has several tabs in which you can customize  different types of rules which are available in <span style="x-condition: READER;">Omea Reader</span><span style="x-condition: PRO;">Omea Pro</span>. These are <strong>Action</strong> rules tab, <strong>Tray Icon</strong> rules, <strong>Font and Color</strong> rules and <strong>Auto Expire</strong> rules. Description of these types of rules follows. </p>
   <h3>Action Rules</h3>
   <p>Using the buttons of this tab you can create new and modify the existing action rules. For details, see <a href="select_rule_actions.html"> Select Rules Actions</a> dialog. </p>
   <h3>Tray Icon Rules</h3>
   <p>Using the buttons of this tab you can create new and modify the existing tray icon rules. For details, see <a href="tray_icon_rule.htm"> Tray Icon Rule</a> dialog. </p>
   <h3>Font and Color Rules</h3>
   <p>Using the buttons of this tab you can create and modify the existing rules for formatting the resource list and applying different colors to it. </p>
   <h3>Auto Expire Rules</h3>
   <p>Using the buttons of this tab you can modify the existing rules for defining when the feeds and newsgroups posts become &#8220;old&#8221; and define actions which Omea has to perform with these resources.</p>
