<h1>Edit Expiration Rule Dialog</h1>

<p class=opt>You can access this dialog when you select one or several feeds or newsgroups in the <strong>Feeds</strong> and <strong>Newsgroups</strong> panes respectively, right-click the feed or newsgroup and select <strong>Edit Expiration Rule</strong> on the pop-up menu or from the <strong>Tools</strong> menu, select <strong>Options <strong>|</strong> Internet <strong>|</strong> Feeds (or Newsgroups) <strong>|</strong>Auto Expiration Rules <strong>|</strong>Edit</strong>. </p>
<p class=opt>The <a href="manage_rules.html"><strong>Manage Rules</strong></a> dialog (<strong>Tools | Manage Rules | Auto-expiration Rules</strong>) lists all auto-expiration rules which you have defined in <span style="x-condition: READER;">Omea Reader</span><span
 style="x-condition: PRO;">Omea Pro</span>.</p>
<p>You have probably come across the situation when you've got a great deal of old items in your feeds and newsgroups. Perhaps you haven't had the time to read all the incoming items, or you may have read all of them  but now there are thousand of RSS posts and newsgroups articles in <span style="x-condition: READER;">Omea Reader</span><span
 style="x-condition: PRO;">Omea Pro</span>. To ease your life and  avoid the information clutter, you need to define the  auto expiration rules. </p>
<p>With <span style="x-condition: READER;">Omea Reader</span><span
 style="x-condition: PRO;">Omea Pro</span> you have two options for defining expiration rules:</p>
<ul>
  <li>you can define the expiration rules which are general (or default) for all feeds and newsgroups or </li>
  <li>you can customize the expiration rule for the selected  feed or newsgroup. </li>
</ul>
<h2>Defining Global Auto Expiration Settings</h2>
<p>You can define global expiration settings for all feeds and newsgroups which you are subscribed to. You can define these global default expiration settings  in Omea's options (<strong>Tools | Options| Internet | Feeds (or Newsgroups)|  Expiration Rules | Edit</strong>). From here you can access and customize two types of expiration rules &#8211; <em>general (or default) expiration rules</em> and <em>expiration rules for those items</em> (feed posts and news articles) <em>which have been deleted</em>.</p>

<p class="caption">Autoexpiration rules dialogs for all News Articles and for deleted News Articles (Omea Reader Options dialog is shown) </p>
<p>The <strong>Edit Expiration Rules</strong> dialogs (which appear after you click the <strong>Advanced</strong> button in the dialogs displayed in picture above) are much like any dialog for managing Rules in <span style="x-condition: READER;">Omea Reader</span><span
 style="x-condition: PRO;">Omea Pro</span> (see <a href="new_edit_rule.html">New  Action Rule/Edit Action Rule dialog</a> and <a href="tray_icon_rule.htm">Tray Icon Rule Dialog</a>). In these dialogs you can set the required conditions and exceptions, and define actions which you want <span style="x-condition: READER;">Omea Reader</span><span
 style="x-condition: PRO;">Omea Pro</span> to perform with the resources which match the required conditions and exceptions. You can control how &#8220;old&#8221; your resources are and how many resources   feeds or  newsgroups can contain. It is supposed that those messages which you have left unread or marked with flags and annotated are meaningful for you so you can tell Omea to preserve them  on your local system. </p>
<p>Both dialogs contain two major areas &#8212; <strong>Conditions</strong> and <strong>Actions</strong> which show and allow you to change the default autoexpiration settings for all feeds and newsgroups and for deleted feed posts and newsgroup articles. To access more sophisticated options which will allow you to control the autoexpiration settings, click <strong>Advanced</strong>&#8230;</p>
<p>You have got several variants of actions which can be applied to the resources which you tell  Omea to consider as &#8220;old&#8221; or expired . You can tell Omea to delete your resources, so they will be moved to the <a href="../organizing/organizing_using_views.html#viewdeletedresources"><strong>Deleted Resources</strong></a> folder in the <strong>Views and Categories</strong> pane  or mark the resources as <strong>Read</strong> so the <strong>Unread</strong> status won't bother you no more. </p>
<h2>Defining Per-feed and Per-newsgroup Auto-Expiration Settings </h2>
<p>Defining the per-feed and per-newsgroup settings in <span style="x-condition: READER;">Omea Reader</span><span
 style="x-condition: PRO;">Omea Pro</span>  is quite easy. Just select one or more feeds or newsgroups in the <strong>Feeds</strong> and <strong>Newsgroups</strong> panes respectively, right-click and select <strong>Edit Expiration Rules</strong>.  In the dialog which opens, define the expiration rule conditions and exceptions and click the <strong>Advanced</strong> button to define more sophisticated expiration settings. </p>
