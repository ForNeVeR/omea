<h1>Introducing Omea Reader</h1>

<p>Welcome to Omea Reader... a uniquely different, productive, and affordable
 way to work with web pages, newsgroups, and web feeds! What exactly <em>is</em>
 Omea Reader? It's actually several things rolled into one.</p>

<p><strong style="font-weight: bold;">It's an Internet Information Depot:</strong><br
 />
Omea Reader is a unique &quot;Personal Reading Environment&quot; that does
 away with the need for separate programs to handle different kinds of
 on-line information such as web pages, internet newsgroups, and RSS and
 Atom feeds. Now you can work with all these different types of information
 in one unified interface. But there's much more to Omea Reader than just
 acting as a central information depot.</p>

<p><strong style="font-weight: bold;">It's an Information Organizer:</strong><br
 />
Omea Reader is also part information organizer... a &quot;Personal Information
 Environment&quot;, if you will. With Omea Reader you can organize internet
 information resources stored on your computer in ways that are meaningful
 to <em>you</em>, rather than to your computer's operating system or some
 application program. You can organize information in-flows according to
 your daily activities, current projects, people you connect with, etc.
 </p>

<p>If some information is relevant to more than one thing, you can link
 to it from multiple contexts and Omea Reader will find it when you work
 in any of them. Say you have web pages and news articles that relate to
 a project you are responsible for, and also to your supervision of employees.
 You can create separate &quot;Categories&quot; for your Project and your
 Employee Supervision activities. You can also create customs &quot;Views&quot;
 that show all information related to your contact with an individual employee
 or colleague. You can create custom &quot;Workspaces&quot; that let you
 deal with any one of these as a separate context where you'll be able
 to quickly access the relevant resources. But there's more yet to Omea
 Reader.</p>

<p><strong style="font-weight: bold;">It's a Search Engine:</strong><br
 />
No matter how well you organize your downloaded information, chances are
 in a few weeks or months you won't remember exactly what it is or how
 to locate it in your organization scheme. That's why Omea Reader is also
 part search engine. Not for the internet, but for information stored on
 your PC. Just as an internet search engine does for content on the web,
 so Omea Reader indexes and cross-links downloaded content on your computer.
 That enables you to find information resources on your machine that relate
 to your search query regardless of when you received it, where it's stored,
 or what kind of resource it is... a web page, a newsgroup article, or
 a feed posting. And searches are lightning fast.</p>
<p><strong>It's a web research tool:</strong><br>
Many activities today require people to collect, organize and share online information from many different resources &#8212; emails, feeds, news articles, files, websites&#8230; </p>
<p>Using Omea Reader's Clippings (excerpts of text for later reference), you can &#8220;cut&#8221; and save the pieces of information easily both from within Omea Pro and such web browsers as Internet Explorer<sup>&copy;</sup>, Firefox<sup>&copy;</sup>, and Mozilla<sup>&copy;</sup>. Additionally, you can create bookmarks of web pages both in Omea Reader and web browsers.</p>
<p>After your collection of Clippings and web pages is ready or in the process of its creation, you can apply multiple Omea's organizational features to them &#8212; associate your Clippings and web bookmarks with one or several Categories, write notes on why you consider these items useful, and so on. And also share your Clippings with other Omea Reader users instantly. </p>
<p><strong style="font-weight: bold;">It's All This and More...</strong><br
 />
So far we haven't touched on any of the many convenience and productivity
 features found in Omea Reader... free-form text annotations, custom cross-linking
 of resources, automatic, intelligent &quot;see also&quot; links to potentially
 relevant resources, shortcuts to resources you need most often, and more.
 Everything fits together to deliver a smart, easy to learn, easy to use
 solution for processing and organizing electronic information from the
 internet.</p>

<h2>Who Should Use Omea Reader?</h2>

<p>Anyone who uses internet-based information as part of their daily work
 can use Omea Reader. However, Omea Reader was really designed for people
 who are inundated with electronic information. Someone who accesses a
 lot of online information, who needs to process or deal with that information
 in some way (either immediately or later), and who needs (or might need)
 to locate and refer to that information in the future... such people are
 most likely to gain significant productivity benefits from using Omea
 Reader.</p>
