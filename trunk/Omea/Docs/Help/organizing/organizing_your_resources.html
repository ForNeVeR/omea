   <h1>Organizing your resources</h1>
	<p>This section of Help explains the various ways <span style="x-condition: READER;">Omea Reader
	</span><span style="x-condition: PRO;">Omea Pro</span> enables you to organize your computer&#146;s 
	resources after they have been <a href="../getstarted/indexing_your_computers_resources.html">
	indexed</a>.</p>
    
	<p><span style="x-condition: READER;">Omea Reader</span><span style="x-condition: PRO;">Omea Pro</span> 
	provides a number of features that enable unprecedented flexibility of organization. There is no 
	&quot;best&quot; approach or technique to organizing your resources. This topic suggests a basic 
	approach and then provides links to more detailed topics on each of the organizational features. 
	You should look over these topics to familiarize yourself with the features. Afterwards you should 
	know enough to begin setting up your own organization system.</p>
	
	<h2>A Suggested Basic Approach to Organizing</h2>
	<h3>Categories</h3>
	<p>Your first line of attack for organizing your resources should probably be 
	  <a href="organizing_using_categories.html"><em>Categories</em></a>. You can use these to create your 
	own filing system for your <span style="x-condition: READER;">on-line</span><span style="x-condition: PRO;">computer&#146;s</span> 
	resources. <span style="x-condition: PRO;">As new things arrive,</span>
	<span style="x-condition: READER;">As you access on-line information,</span> you &quot;pigeonhole&quot; things wherever you think they belong. Moreover, you can  file the same resource in 
	<em>multiple</em> Categories.</p>
	<h3>Views</h3>
	<p>As your organization scheme begins to take shape, you may want to experiment with custom <em><a href="organizing_using_views.html">Views</a></em>. Unlike Categories, which organize <em>what you have</em>, Views organize <em>how you browse and access</em> what you have. Like the default &quot;pre-fabricated&quot; Views such as <em>Unread</em> and <em>Today</em>, your custom Views can zero in on some subset of your resources. <span style="x-condition: READER;">Omea Reader</span><span style="x-condition: PRO;">Omea Pro</span> provides a broad range of selection criteria that you can combine to create most any kind of View you can think of.</p>
	<h3>Links </h3>
	<p>As you file resources in your Categories, the structure of which can be as simple or complex as you choose, you 
	  can create <a href="organizing_using_links.html"><em>Links</em></a> to other related or relevant resources of any type.</p>
  <div style="x-condition: PRO;">
  <h3>Tasks</h3>
  <p>For some incoming resources you may want to create a <a href="organizing_using_tasks.html"><em>Task</em></a> at the same time you file it in your Categories (or directly from your Inbox). That creates a 
		new item in your To Do list that&#146;s already linked to the incoming resource. You can create 
		links to any other resources you will need to handle the Task, plus you can add a due date, a 
	reminder, and more.</p>
  </div>
 
    <h3>Workspaces    </h3>
 

	<p>You can expand the scope of what can be done with Views by creating <a href="organizing_using_workspaces.html">
	<em>Workspaces</em></a>. These are essentially larger, broader Views... subsets of your resources 
	that create a meaningful context for some part of your work or activities.</p>
