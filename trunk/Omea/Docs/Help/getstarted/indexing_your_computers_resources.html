<h1>Indexing Your Computer’s Resources</h1>

<p>As mentioned in the <a href="../overview/key_concepts.html">Key Concepts</a> 
 topic, <span style="x-condition: READER;">Omea Reader</span><span style="x-condition: PRO;">Omea 
 Pro</span> keeps track of the resources stored on your computer by means 
 of an indexed database. This is compared to the engine in your car... 
 it’s a key piece of the vehicle, but you don’t have to be a technical 
 expert to use it.</p>

<p><span style="x-condition: PRO;">Most of the time you</span><span style="x-condition: READER;">When 
 using Omea Reader, you</span> will not need to concern yourself with the 
 indexing process at all. It will happen in the background automatically 
 as you work in <span style="x-condition: READER;">Omea Reader</span><span 
 style="x-condition: PRO;">Omea Pro</span>. As you receive, file, categorize, 
 <span style="x-condition: PRO;">link, and communicate resources,</span> 
 <span style="x-condition: READER;">and link resources,</span> everything 
 is tracked in real time and available to search any time. <span style="x-condition: PRO;">However, 
 there <em>are</em> times when you do need to think about indexing, and 
 to configure Omea so that it indexes all the content you want to search 
 or browse with Omea (and excludes any that you don’t).</span></p>

<p>This topic discusses initial indexing of resources to get started, and 
 also covers how to do any ongoing modifications to the indexing configuration 
 that you may need from time to time.</p>

<a name=initial></a>

<h2>Initial Indexing</h2>

<div style="x-condition: PRO;">
<p>Until <span style="x-condition: READER;">Omea Reader</span><span style="x-condition: PRO;">Omea 
 Pro</span> creates its index of your computer’s resources, you can’t really 
 benefit from any of its features. So before you begin working with it, 
 you need to allow <span style="x-condition: READER;">Omea Reader</span><span 
 style="x-condition: PRO;">Omea Pro</span> to generate an initial resource 
 index.</p>

<p>When you start Omea for the first time, it presents a special &quot;wizard&quot; 
 that guides you through some steps in which you specify various options 
 for creating the initial index. The options you can set with this wizard 
 include:</p>

<ul>
	
	<li class=kadov-p>How much content to index initially. You can choose 
 to index only resources dated within the last 2 weeks (Omea will index 
 the rest in the background later as you work), or all of your resources 
 at once.</li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p>Which file system folders to include (or specifically 
 <em>exclude</em>) from the index.</li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p>Which Outlook folders to include (or exclude) from 
 the index.</li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p>Which bookmarked Web pages to download and index 
 initially (and when the download should occur)</li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p>Which instant messaging programs’ histories to include 
 in the index.</li>
</ul>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>
  </div>
  <p class="note">The indexing process is quite fast. However, the more content you have to index, the longer the process will take. If you have many thousands of e-mails and huge numbers of folders and files, you might want to reserve initial indexing for a time when you won't need to use your computer for a while, such as when you leave work for the day.</p>
</div>
<p>No initial index configuration is necessary. Omea Reader creates its 
     resource index in the background as you access various online resources. 
     Chances are you will not need to change any of the indexing configuration 
     options available in this version of the product.</p>
</div>


<a name=ongoing></a>

<h2>Modifying the Indexing Configuration</h2>

<p>Once <span style="x-condition: PRO;">initial </span>indexing has taken 
 place, you can just work without having to think about it. You would, 
 however, want to modify the indexing configuration in these situations:</p>

<ul>
	
	<li class=kadov-p
		style="x-condition: PRO;">If you create new file system folders or Outlook 
 (e-mail) folders that are not part of a folder tree that is already subject 
 to indexing</li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p
		style="x-condition: PRO;">If you find you want to specifically <em>exclude</em> 
 some folder(s) from indexing when that folder is contained in a folder 
 tree that is subject to indexing</li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p
		style="x-condition: PRO;">If you add a new Outlook address book with contacts 
 that you want to be indexed</li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p
		style="x-condition: PRO;">If you want to activate indexing for a resource type 
 that is not currently activated for indexing. For example, maybe you didn’t 
 initially activate indexing for ICQ instant message histories because 
 you didn’t use ICQ, but then later you begin using it.</li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p
		style="x-condition: READER;">If you want to activate indexing for a resource type 
 that is not currently activated for indexing. For example, maybe you didn’t 
 initially activate indexing for RSS/Atom feeds because you didn’t read 
 any, but then later you wanted to begin reading some.</li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p>If you add a supported Web browser whose Bookmarks 
 you want to have indexed. For example, you may have begun with Internet 
 Explorer bookmarks, but later decided to use a Mozilla browser and now 
 you want to have its bookmarks indexed.</li>
</ul>

<h3>The Options Dialog</h3>

<p>The Options Dialog (<strong>Tools | Options</strong>) provides access 
 to all the various options for configuring the indexing process. It also 
 provides other types of configuration options.</p>

<p>There are a number of option categories within the Options dialog. The 
 following sections point out and briefly discuss those that pertain specifically 
 to configuring indexing. The specific configuration options involved are 
 covered in detail in the reference topic <a href="../reference/options_dialog.html">Reference: 
 Options Dialog</a>.</p>

<div style="x-condition: PRO;">
	
<a name=folders></a>

<h2>Indexing Folders</h2>

<p>In order for Omea to be able to locate resources such as documents or 
 files, the Windows folders that contain them need to be included in the 
 index. You can see all the folders that Omea has indexed in the <strong>Indexed 
 Folders</strong> pane.</p>

<div class=proc>
<p class=procHead>To view the Indexed Folders pane:</p>

<ol>
	
	<li class=kadov-p>Select the <em>Files</em> tab in the main window.</li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p>If the Indexed Folders pane is not visible in the 
 Navigation panel (at the left of the main window), click the <em>Indexed 
 Folders</em> button on the pane selector bar.</li>
</ol>
</div>

<p>You initially specify the folders to index in the Setup Wizard (see 
 <a href="#wizard">above</a>). There, you might, for example, select only 
 your <em>My Documents</em> folder. Then, as you become more familiar with 
 Omea, you realize that you want to be able to access file resources in 
 folders that are not contained under <em>My Documents</em>. You would 
 need to add such folders to the list of indexed folders in the Options 
 dialog: <strong>Tools | Options: Files &amp; Folders: Indexed Folders</strong>.</p>

<p>When you select <em>Indexed Folders</em> in the Options dialog, the 
 right-hand panel shows a list of the folders that are currently subject 
 to indexing. </p>
<p class="caution"><strong>IMPORTANT!</strong> A ll sub-folders 
   of the listed folders are also indexed, <em>unless</em> a sub-folder has been explicitly marked by you as excluded from indexing.</p>

<p class=caption>Windows folders to be indexed by Omea are specified here</p>

<h3>Adding More Folders to the Index</h3>

<p>As mentioned in the preceding paragraph, you don't need to specifically 
 add each and every folder you want to have indexed. You only need to specify 
 highest-level folder in the Windows folder hierarchy that you want to 
 include for indexing. All sub-folders under it will be indexed as well 
 unless you single one or more out to be excluded (see <a href="excluding">Excluding 
 specific sub-folders from the resource index</a> below.</p>

<div class=proc>
<p class=procHead>To add a folder for indexing:</p>

<ol>
	
	<li class=kadov-p>On the main menu choose <strong>Tools: Options: Files 
 &amp; Folders: Indexed Folders</strong>.</li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p>In the Options dialog, click the <strong>Add</strong> 
 button.</li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p>In the Browse for Folder dialog, choose the top-level 
 folder you want to include, or click the <strong>Make New Folder</strong> 
 button to create a new top-level folder, and click OK. The chosen folder 
 now appears in the list of folders in the Options dialog.</li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p>Click on one of the Indexing Mode option buttons 
 to specify how the contents of the new folder should be indexed (see &quot;Folder 
 indexing options&quot; below.</li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p>Click <strong>OK</strong> to accept the addition 
 and close the Options dialog.</li>
</ol>
</div>

<p>The new folder is added to the list of indexed folders, indexed according 
 to the option you specified, and appears in the Indexed Folders pane when 
 you select the Files tab in the main window.</p>

<h3>Removing Folders from the Resource Index</h3>

<p>If you find that some folder that is currently indexed no longer needs 
   to be included in the indexing, you can remove it from the indexed 
   folders list in the Options dialog. Doing so does not delete the folder 
   (and any sub-folders) from your disk drive or storage device, and it is still possible to browse this folder within Omea.  The contents of the folder excluded from indexing  
   will no longer turn up in searches, and all links to resources in the folder tree will be 
   removed.</p>
<div class=proc>
<p class=procHead>To remove a folder from indexing:</p>

<ol>
	
	<li class=kadov-p>On the main menu choose <strong>Tools: Options: Files 
 &amp; Folders: Indexed Folders</strong>.</li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p>In the Options dialog, select the folder(s) you want 
 to remove. (<strong>Shift</strong> + Click to select multiple adjacent folders. Ctrl + 
 Click to select multiple non-adjacent folders).</li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p>Click the <strong>Remove</strong> button to remove 
 the folder(s) from the list.</li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p>Click <strong>OK</strong> to apply the removal and 
 close the Options dialog.</li>
</ol>
</div>

<h3>Folder Indexing Options</h3>

<p>When you add a folder to the list of indexed folders in the Options 
 dialog, you can select one of 3 options that tell Omea how to index that 
 folder:</p>

<ul>
	
	<li class=kadov-p><strong style="font-weight: bold;">Immediate</strong>: 
 Resources in the folder(s) now will be indexed immediately as they are 
 stored in the folder(s).</li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p><strong style="font-weight: bold;">On startup</strong>: 
 Resources in the folder(s) will be indexed when Omea starts up. New resources 
 added during a session are not indexed until the next session.</li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p><strong style="font-weight: bold;">Never</strong>: 
 Resources in the folder(s) will not be indexed.</li>
</ul>

<a name=excluding></a>

<h3>Excluding Specific Sub-folders from the Resource Index</h3>

<p>It’s important to remember that folders in the Indexed Folders list 
 in the Options dialog are top-level folders. Whatever indexing option 
 applies to that folder also applies to any sub-folders under it.</p>

<p>Suppose you have indexed your <em>My Documents</em> folder, but it contains 
 a sub-folder named <em>Private</em> (which has other sub-folders under 
 it) that you want to specifically <em>exclude</em> from indexing in Omea. 
 Here’s how you would do it.</p>

<div class=proc>
<p class=procHead>To exclude <em>My Documents\Private</em> from indexing:</p>

<ol>
	
	<li class=kadov-p>Add <em>C:\My Documents\Private</em> to the Indexed 
 Folders list in the Options dialog.</li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p>Select <strong>Never</strong> in the list in the 
 <em>Indexed</em> column to the right of the folder.</li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p>Click <strong>OK</strong> to accept the change and close the Options 
 dialog.</li>
</ol>
</div>

<p>The contents of the <em>Private</em> folder and its sub-folders will 
 not be indexed and will not appear in Omea browse mechanisms or searches.</p>
<div class="note">
  <div class="noteImg"
	style="/*begin!kadov{{*/ x-right: 944px; x-bottom: 3017px; /*}}end!kadov*/ ">
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
  </div>
  <p class="note">Please note that when you press the <strong>Delete (<img src="../images/iconsMarks/icon_delete_button.png" class="linkIcon">) </strong> on the toolbar, you delete resources physically from Omea and/or your local system but when you <em>exclude</em> the resources from indexing, they still remain on your PC but won't appear in search results. </p>
</div>
<p><a name=outlook></a></p>
<h2>Indexing Outlook Folders</h2>

<p>In order for Omea to be able to locate resources such as e-mail messages 
 and e-mail attachments, the MS Outlook folders that contain them need 
 to be included in the index. You can see the Outlook folders that Omea 
 has indexed in the Outlook Folders pane.</p>

<div class=proc>
<p class=procHead>To view the Outlook Folders pane:</p>

<ol>
	
	<li class=kadov-p>Select the <em>E-mail</em> tab in the main window.</li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p>If the Outlook Folders pane is not visible in the 
 Navigation panel (at the left of the main window), click the <em>Outlook 
 Folders</em> button on the pane selector bar.</li>
</ol>
</div>

<h3>Initial Indexing via the Startup Wizard</h3>

<p>You initially specify the Outlook folders to index in the Setup Wizard 
 (see <a href="#wizard">above</a>). There, you might, for example, select 
 only your Inbox folder. Then, as you become more familiar with Omea, you 
 realize that you want to be able to access file resources in Outlook folders 
 that are not contained under Inbox. You would need to add such folders 
 to the list of indexed Outlook folders in the <strong>Options dialog: 
 Tools | Options: MS Outlook: Outlook Folders</strong>.</p>

<!--kadov_tag{{<implicit_p>}}--><img src="..\images\sshots\dialogs\pro\options_outlook_folders.png"

									width=678
									height=571
									border=0> 

<p class=caption>MS Outlook folders to be indexed by Omea are specified 
 here</p>

<h3>Adding More Folders or Sub-folders for Indexing</h3>

<p>Unlike Windows folders, Omea automatically detects all your MS Outlook 
 e-mail folders and includes them in the index. To add another Outlook 
 folder, simply add one in the Outlook Folders pane (left navigation panel) 
 or in Outlook itself. </p>
<div class="note">
  <div class="noteImg"
	style="/*begin!kadov{{*/ x-right: 944px; x-bottom: 3017px; /*}}end!kadov*/ ">
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
  </div>
  <p class="note">When Omea indexes the remote public folders and address books, it may take rather long and greatly depends on the amount of information these folders contain and your connection speed. </p>
</div>
<h3>Excluding Specific Folders from Indexing</h3>

<p>Because all Outlook folders are automatically included in the index, 
 you need to explicitly <em>exclude</em> and Outlook folder(s) you do not 
 want Omea to Index. For example, you might exclude the Outbox folder since 
 messages don’t usually stay there for long and therefore, searches will 
  never yield any results from that folder.</p>

<div class=proc>
<p class=procHead>To exclude an Outlook folder from indexing:</p>

<ol>
	
	<li class=kadov-p      >Main menu: <strong>Tools | Options.</strong></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p>Options dialog: <em>MS Outlook: Outlook Folders.</em></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p>In the Outlook Folders list, expand the treeview 
 as necessary and locate the folder you want excluded from the index.</li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p>Clear the check box next to the folder name and click <strong>OK</strong> to save changes.</li>
</ol>
</div>

<h2>Indexing Instant Messaging (IM) Histories</h2>

<p>Support for instant messaging in Omea is accomplished via <em>plugins</em> &#8212; small software modules that can be turned off if the feature they support 
 is not used. (For more information, see <a href="..\reference\plugins.html">plugins 
 reference</a>.</p>

<p>In order for Omea to be able to locate instant messages in searches, 
 the message histories of supported instant messaging (IM) programs need 
 to be included in the index. In order to include the message history of 
 an IM program, the supporting plugin must be installed <em>and</em> activated 
 in the Options dialog. Once this is done, Omea detects all accounts for 
 each installed and activated IM program and displays these in the options 
 for each IM program:</p>

<!--kadov_tag{{<implicit_p>}}--><img src="..\images\sshots\dialogs\pro\options_icq.png"
									title="IM options showing accounts detected for ICQ"
									alt="Options dialog"
									style="width: 678px;
											height: 571px;
											border-style: none;
											border-style: none;"
									width=678
									height=571
									border=0> 

<p class=caption>IM options showing accounts detected for ICQ</p>

<h3>Adding an IM History to the Resource Index</h3>

<p>You only need to do this if you add more accounts to a supported instant 
 messaging program, or if you already have multiple accounts on any IM 
 platform... if you have more than one ICQ account, for example.</p>

<p>The figure above shows 2 ICQ accounts have been detected by Omea. The 
 check box for the first account is checked, meaning the message history 
 for that account is included in the Omea index. The second account is 
 not checked, meaning its history is not indexed. If you wanted to index 
 the history of that account, check the check box.</p>

<h3>Removing an IM History to the Resource Index</h3>

<p>If you want Omea to stop indexing the message history of an IM account, 
 clear the check box next to the account details.</p>

<p>The index is cleared of all messages and contacts for the account, and 
 searches will no longer yield any results from it. <em>The IM account 
 is not removed...</em> it just becomes &quot;invisible&quot; to Omea.</p>
