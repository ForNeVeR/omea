<h1>Using <span style="x-condition: READER;">Omea Reader</span><span style="x-condition: PRO;">Omea 
 Pro</span> with Feeds and Weblogs</h1>

<p><span style="x-condition: READER;">Omea Reader</span><span style="x-condition: PRO;">Omea 
 Pro</span> has a built-in feed reader that supports both RSS and Atom (including ATOM 1.0)
 feeds. You can subscribe to feeds individually, or by importing an exported 
 OPML file from another aggregator (reader). You can export your <span 
 style="x-condition: READER;">Omea Reader</span> <span style="x-condition: PRO;">Omea 
 Pro</span> feed subscriptions to OPML format as well.</p>

<p>RSS and Atom feeds are often published by weblogs (a.k.a. &quot;blogs&quot;). 
 If there is a third-party Weblog Posting Extension plugin for your particular 
 weblog, and if you install that plugin via the <a href="../reference/feeds.html">Feeds 
 options</a>, you can post a new item into your blog that references the 
 post in the weblog you are currently reading in <span style="x-condition: READER;">Omea 
 Reader</span> <span style="x-condition: PRO;">Omea Pro</span>.</p>

<a name=subscribing></a>

<h2>Subscribing to a Feed</h2>

<p>The subscription process is the same for both RSS and Atom feeds.</p>


<h3>Subscribing to an Individual Feed</h3>

<p>To subscribe to a feed, you must know the URL of the feed data file. 
 This is an XML file which has the feed’s data either in RSS or Atom format. 
 If you don’t know the URL of the feed data file itself, but you do know 
 the URL of the web site that hosts the feed, <span style="x-condition: READER;">Omea 
 Reader</span><span style="x-condition: PRO;">Omea Pro</span> will try 
 to locate all the feed data files at that URL. If it finds one or more, 
 it reports them to you so you can decide which feed(s) to subscribe to.</p>

<div class=proc>
<p class=procHead>To subscribe to a feed:</p>

<ol>
	
	<li class=kadov-p>Select the <strong>Feeds</strong> tab in the Main 
 window.</li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p>
	Either... 
	
	<ul>
		
		<li class=kadov-p><p>Choose <strong>Tools | Subscribe to Feed</strong> 
 on the Main menu. </p></li>

 pane and choose <strong>Subscribe to Feed</strong> on the context menu, 
 or... </li>

										height=483
										border=0></p>
	<p class=caption>Subscribe to Feed wizard (step 1)</p>
	<li class=kadov-p>Enter the URL (address) of the feed on the web. This 
 is the address of the feed data file, not a web page. Your entry should 
 be something like:<br />
	<code><strong>http://somesite.com/feeds/productnews<span style="color: #0000ff;">.xml</span></strong></code> 
 <br />
	<br />
	If you are not sure of the exact address of the feed, you can enter 
 the URL of the site and <span style="x-condition: READER;">Omea Reader</span><span 
 style="x-condition: PRO;">Omea Pro</span> will try to find any feed data 
 files there. </li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p>If the feed you are subscribing to requires you to 
 log in, and you either you have never logged in before, or you have logged 
 in using Internet Explorer© and the browser is not set to remember your 
 login information, then check the box next to <em>The feed requires an 
 HTTP login</em>, and supply the user name and password. </li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p>
	Click <strong>Next</strong>. 
	
	<ul>
		
		<li class=kadov-p>
		If you entered a valid URL for a feed data file, the dialog offers 
 you the option of specifying a title to appear in the <strong>Feeds</strong> 
 pane, and of specifying a Feed Folder or creating a new Feed Folder in which the feed will appear in the <strong>Feeds</strong> pane. 
 Optionally change the title and specify or create a Feed Folder, and click 
 <strong>Finish</strong> to complete the subscription.<br />

		<p class=caption>Multiple feeds found at a web site URL</p>
		
		<p>Check the desired feed or feeds and click <strong>Next</strong>. The 
 dialog will offer the option of re-titling and selection of Feed Folder 
 as described above (if you have selected one feed to subscribe to). If several feeds are selected, you won't be able to edit the feed title at this step of the startup wizard but you can easily change it in the <a href="../reference/feed_properties_dialog.html">Feed Properties dialog</a>. Click <strong>Finish</strong> on that screen to complete 
 the subscription.</p>

<h2>Other Possibilities for Subscribing to Feeds</h2>

<h3>Subscribing from the Internet Browsers</h3>

<p>You can subscribe to the feeds from within Mozilla<sup>©</sup>, Firefox<sup>©</sup>, and 
 Internet Explorer<sup>©</sup> using <a href="working_with_mozilla_browser_plugin.htm">Omea Connector plugin</a> and <a href="working_with_ie_add-on.htm">Omea Add-on</a> respectively. The plugin is installed automatically in Internet Explorer<sup>©</sup> and you need to install it manually for Mozilla-based browsers. After the plugins are installed, a special toolbar for subscribing to feeds appears. </p>
<p><img src="../images/sshots/shared/mozilla_toolbar.png" alt="Toobar in Mozilla " width="426" height="214"></p>
<p class="caption">A toolbar in Mozilla<sup>©</sup> (it looks the same in Firefox<sup>©</sup> and Internet Explorer<sup>©</sup>) </p>
<p>Using Omea Connector Plugin for Mozilla<sup>©</sup> and Firefox<sup>©</sup> you can subscribe 
 to the feeds both when <span style="x-condition: READER;">Omea Reader</span><span 
 style="x-condition: PRO;">Omea Pro</span> is running or when it is turned 
 off. Omea Add-on for Internet Explorer<sup>©</sup> provides the same possibilities 
 for subscribing to feeds &#8212; simply click Subscribe to Feed button on this toolbar and then follow the instructions of Omea's <em>Subscribe to Feed</em> wizard. For more information, refer to <a href="working_with_mozilla_browser_plugin.htm">Working 
 with Browser Plugins</a>. </p>
<a name=draganddrop></a>
<h3>Subscribing using Drag-and-Drop Mechanism</h3>

<p>You can also subscribe to feed by dragging the address of the web page 
 or the link on the web page (in some external web browser) and dropping this link to any place of the 
 <strong>Feeds</strong> pane in <span style="x-condition: READER;">Omea 
 Reader</span><span style="x-condition: PRO;">Omea Pro</span>. <span class=caption>If 
 you already have some Feed Folders and want to add the feed subscription 
 to some group, the Feed Folder to which you want to drop the web link becomes 
 selected (the rectangle border appears around the Feed Folder name) and 
 the mouse pointer changes its appearance as in figure below. </span></p>

<p class=caption>Dropping the web link from the external browser to the Feeds pane</p>

<p>Once you release the mouse button, the <strong>Subscribe to Feed</strong> 
 wizard opens. Follow the wizard instructions to subscribe to the feed. </p>
<div class=tip>
        <div class=tipImg

        </div>
        <p class=tip>Please note that you can subscribe to feeds using drag-and-drop mechanism only from the external web browsers. </p>
  </div>

<a name=subcribingtosearchfeeds></a>
<h2>Subscribing to Search Feeds</h2>
<p>Now you can search the entries of the words which you specify as a search criteria to look for  in different feed search engines which are <strong>Feedster</strong>, <strong>Google News, MSN Search, Yahoo! Search, Blogdigger, </strong> and <strong>blogs.yandex.ru</strong>. Once you specify the search criteria and come through the feed subscription wizard, Omea will detect if the entries of words you specify appear in the feeds listed on the search engine. You can also set notifications to be aware of the changes in the blogs mentioned on the chosen feeds search engine. </p>
<p>Subscribing to the search feed is very much like the subscribe to feed procedure (see <strong>Subscribe to feed</strong> above). To call this wizard, from the <strong>Tools</strong>, select <strong>Subscribe to Search Feed</strong> or right-click any space of the <strong>Feeds</strong> pane and select the same on the shortcut menu. </p>
<p><img src="../images/sshots/dialogs/shared/subscribe_to_search_feed.png" alt="Subscribe to Search feed dialog"></p>
<p class="caption">Subscribe to Search Feed dialog (word &#8220;Omea&#8221; is entered as a search keyword and the &#8220;Blogdigger&#8221; search engine is selected) </p>
<p>Once you have come through the <strong>Subscribe to Search Feed</strong> wizard, the feeds mentioning the search keyword(s) you have specified and registered on the search engine which you have selected are downloaded and appear in the <strong>Items List</strong>. </p>
<p><img src="../images/sshots/shared/subscribe_to_search_feed_il.png" alt="Illustration of how you can subscribe to search feed" width="718" height="841"></p>
<p class="caption">Illustration of how Omea searches for entries of the keywords using different blogs search engines </p>
<p>Once you are subscribed to the search feed, and you update all feeds or the feed which contains the results of search, new items which appeared and can be retrieved by the search feed, appear in Omea as well. So you will always be up-to-date with tracking the entries of the words which you have specified when subscribing to the search feed. </p>

        </div>
        <p class=tip>When searching using MSN and Yahoo! search engines, Omea finds instances of words or phrases on the web but not in blogs (feeds). </p>

<h3>Importing Feed Subscriptions from Other Readers and OPML Files</h3>

<p>If you have been reading feeds in a different aggregator (reader), you 
 can import your subscriptions from that program into <span style="x-condition: READER;">Omea 
 Reader</span><span style="x-condition: PRO;">Omea Pro</span>. You can now import subscriptions from <em>Bloglines</em>, <em>RSS Bandit</em>, <em>SharpReader</em> and <em>FeedDemon</em> or import your subscriptions which you have previously saved in <em>OPML file</em>. </p>
<div class=proc>
<p class=procHead>To import feed subscriptions from other readers and OPML files:</p>

<ol>
	
	<li class=kadov-p>Use the Export feature of your other feed reader 
 program to export your feed subscriptions to an OPML file.</li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p>Start Omea and choose <strong>File | Import Feed Subscriptions </strong> 
 on the main menu or right-click in any place of the <strong>Feeds</strong> pane and select <strong>Import Feed Subscriptions&#8230;</strong>.<br>
	The <strong>Import Feed Subscriptions</strong> wizard appears.</li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p>Select one or several readers from which you want to import your feed subscriptions or OPML file and follow the wizard directions.<br>
	  <div class=tip>
        <div class=tipImg
	style="/*begin!kadov{{*/ x-right: 747px; x-bottom: 776px; /*}}end!kadov*/ ">
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
        </div>
        <p class=tip>If you are not certain how many feeds the OPML file will subscribe to, or what all of the feeds are, check <strong>Preview feed before import</strong> option. In the <strong>Subscription Import Preview</strong> dialog, select (check) the feeds which you want to import. </p>
	    </div>
	  </li>
	<li class=kadov-p>If you selected <em>Bloglines</em>, type your <em>Bloglines login</em>  and <em>password</em> when prompted and click <em>Next</em> or <em>Finish</em>. </li>
	<li class=kadov-p>If you selected <em>OPML files</em>, click <strong>Add File</strong> to add the feed subscriptions stored in files or <strong>Add URL</strong> to navigate to the desired feed subscription file when prompted and click <em>Next</em> or <em>Finish</em>. Some feed publishers provide an OPML file on the web, enabling 
   you to subscribe to one or more of their feeds. You can import these subscriptions 
   from the online OPML file. Just enter its URL on this step.</li>
	<li class=kadov-p>When you are done, click <strong>Finish</strong>.<br>
	  The imported feeds will appear in the <strong>Feeds</strong> pane of the <strong>Feeds</strong> Tab. </li>

 by clicking on the different column headers.</p>
<p>&#8220;<em>Newspaper</em>&#8221; View for feeds provides you with maximum flexibility for customizing and reading your feed posts. In this View, the feed posts follow each other like chapters in the book. </p>
  <P>Newspaper View can be applied to all Views in the <strong>Feeds</strong> tab (such as <em>Today</em>, <em>Unread</em>) or you can </P>
  <ul>
    <li>view the selected feeds as Newspaper, </li>

  <h4>Main Possibilities for working with Newspaper View </h4>
  <p><strong>Paging</strong>: You can specify the number of feeds posts you can view on a single &#8220;newspaper page&#8221; by selecting from 10 to 100 items per page from the toolbar which is located at the bottom of the Feeds list. If the feed contains many entries, you can easily browse through them by clicking on the pages buttons in the Feeds toolbar. </p>

<h2>Expiring Feeds Posts</h2>
<p>You can set the auto-expiration rules both globally (in the <a href="../reference/feeds.html">Feeds Options dialog</a>). For more information, see <a href="../reference/auto_expiration_rule_dialog.htm">Auto-expiration Rules dialog</a>.</p>

<h2>Downloading Feed Enclosures</h2>
<p>Some of the feeds which you are subscribed to may contain enclosures or files&#8230; Enclosure in general is something (usually a supporting document) that is enclosed in an envelope with a covering letter. In terms of  Omea enclosure is a file that is &#8220;attached&#8221; to the feed post. </p>
<p>Downloading feed enclosures in Omea is quite simple. If the feed contains enclosures, the web link to these enclosures is in the bottom of the feed post in the <strong>Item Viewer</strong>. Besides, the <strong>Items List</strong> has a column <strong>Enclosure Downloading State</strong>. Picture below illustrates that.</p>
<p><img src="../images/sshots/shared/enclosures_download_status_.png" alt="Enlcosures download state illustration" width="729" height="222"></p>
<p class="caption">Illustration of enclosures download state </p>
<p> </p>
<div class="proc"> 
  <p class="prochead">To download a feed enclosure:</p>
  <ol> 
  <li class=kadov-p>Select the feed post in the <strong>Items List</strong>. </li>
  <li class=kadov-p>Do one of the following:
    <ul>
      <li>Right-click and select <strong>Queue Downloading Enclosure</strong> </li>
      <li>Click the <strong>Enclosure</strong> column icon <img src="../images/iconsMarks/ico_enclosure_not_downloaded.png" width="16" height="16" class="linkIcon"> for the corresponding resource.</li>
     
  </ul>
  </li>
    <p>The feed enclosure will start downloading; the column icon will change to <img src="../images/iconsMarks/ico_enclosure_planned_for_downloading.png" width="16" height="16" class="linkIcon"> and if you move the mouse pointer to the column sign, you can see the enclosure download progress in the tooltip. When the file is downloaded, the notification balloon appears in the lower right part of the screen and the download state icon changes to <img src="../images/iconsMarks/ico_enclosure_download_complete.png" width="16" height="16" class="linkIcon"> and the notification balloon appears in the lower-right corner of the screen. </p>
	    <p>You can also use this method: follow (click) the enclosure URL in the feed post, the enclosure will start downloading. If the enclosure file type is, for example, &#8220;<em>mp3</em>&#8221;, Windows Media Player<sup>&reg;</sup> or other program which is used in your system to process this file type, will open. </p>
    </ol>
</div>
<h3> Accessing Downloaded Enclosures</h3>
<p>When the enclosure download is complete, you can access the downloaded files in the file directory
which you have specified in <a href="../reference/feeds_enclosures.htm">Omea's feeds enclosures settings</a> and
<a href="../reference/feed_properties_dialog.html">Feed properties dialog</a>. You can also right-click the
feed post which has the downloaded enclosure and select <strong>Locate on Disk</strong>. Omea will open the folder
which contains the enclosures. By default, it is &#8220;<strong>My Enclosures</strong>&#8221; folder.</p>
<p>Alternatively you can open the enclosure directly in the associated application by right-clicking on the enclosure icon
and selecting <strong>Run Enclosure Program</strong> on the context menu.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p class=note>Omea  can download only once enclosure at a time, though you can and all other enclosures will be pending for downloading. </p>
  <p class=note>If you have specified the download period in <a href="../reference/feed_properties_dialog.html">Feeds  Properties dialog</a>, the enclosures will be downloaded only during that period. Once you set the enclosure for downloading, the column icon will change to  <img src="../images/iconsMarks/ico_enclosure_planned_for_downloading.png" width="16" height="16" class="linkIcon"> and the download will take place only download period defined in the <a href="../reference/feeds.html">Feed Options dialog</a>. </p>
  </blockquote>
</div>
<h3>Canceling Downloading Enclosures</h3>
<p>If you have mistakenly started downloading the feed enclosure, you can easily cancel it. Select the enclosure which is already downloaded or is pending for downloading and select Cancel Downloading Enclosure. The enclosure will not be downloaded and the state column icon will change to <strong>Not Downloaded</strong> (<img src="../images/iconsMarks/ico_enclosure_not_downloaded.png" width="16" height="16" class="linkIcon">). You can start downloading enclosures any time later. </p>
<h3>Deleting an Enclosure</h3>
<p>You can delete an already downloaded enclosure directly from Omea - right-click on the enclosure icon
and select <strong>Delete Enclosure</strong> on the context menu. </p>
<h3>Customizing Feeds Items List</h3>
<p>To increase your productivity of working with enclosures and always have the required information at hand, you can customize Omea's <strong>Items List</strong>. To do so, you need to call the <a href="../reference/columns_dialog.html"> Configure Columns dialog</a>. You can access this dialog from the context menu of the column headers in the main window <strong>Items List</strong> or from the <strong>View</strong> menu, select <strong>Configure Columns&#8230;</strong></p>
<h4>Enclosure Downloading State</h4>
<p>Represents the state (planned for downloading, in progress, completed, failed) of downloading the feed enclosures. </p>
<h4>Enclosure Size</h4>
<p>Provides information about the size of the enclosure in bytes.</p>
