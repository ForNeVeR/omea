		<content type="text/html" mode="escaped"><![CDATA[<p>Like many others, I've now got Google Desktop search running on my PC.  With Google Desktop installed, it indexes most stuff on my hard drive and presents the results within the Google interface millions of people around the world are familiar with.  </p>

<p>It indexes your word documents, Outlook email, Excel Spreadsheets and the real killer for me, the contents of the web pages that you have ALREADY visited with the desktop application installed.   </p>

<p>HOWEVER, the ability to search web pages already seen is only possible if you are browsing using IE.  It will only index your email if you are using Outlook or Outlook Express.   What about Gmail or other email readers?   The ability to index Instant Messages does not extend to those of us using MSN Messenger.   And I'm afraid Mac users are left felling left out again.    For me, not being able to index Gmail is a big omission.    Note to self.  Does it index and make searchable <b style='background:#00ffff;'><b style='background:#00ffff;'><b style='background:#00ffff;'><b style='background:#00ffff;'>RSS</b></b></b> <b style='background:#00ffff;'><b style='background:#00ffff;'>feed</b></b></b>s if using Newsgator integrated with Outlook?  </p>

<p>Privacy is another issue.  You can choose to OPT OUT of sending stuff about your hard drive back to Google.  If you don't untick that box, what happens to the data sent to Google?  What data exactly goes back to Google?  Can or will this eventually be used to present you with PERSONALLY RELEVANT AND UNIQUE results in response to any given search?  If so, count me in, though I'd need to inform myself a little better about the privacy issues.   </p>

<p>It just struck me that what we now have as a result of a search IS personally unique results, based on our own local information being seamlessly integrated into the top part of the search results page.   I wonder how difficult it is to take the next leap and integrate my local information into the algorithm and use it as as one of the 150 plus factors that define what SERPS I see on the page. </p>

<p>All in all its not perfect, but it is a BIG step forward in the evolution of search. </p>

<p>I had one of those "Euraka" moments when I temporarily forgot that I had installed it and did a search for something on Google.com and noticed relevant results from MY Files at the top of the page.  Instantaneous.  Wow.   </p>

<p>Those of us interested in search marketing have other issues to think about and perhaps play with.  In an interview with <a href="http://battellemedia.com/">John Battelle</a>,  Google Director of consumer web product Marissa Mayer, </p>

<p> <blockquote>How does the Google Desktop Search do ranking on a person's hard drive?<br />
The default rank is by date. (When we tested, we learned that) people understood the context of "when they did see this"? The results list the last time you accessed any particular document. However you can also sort by relevance. The desktop relevance scheme lacks Pagerank (of course), but it does incorporate the other 150 factors (Google uses on the web) - factors like are the (keywords) together, in bold, related, things like that. </blockquote></p>

<p>mmm, I can see webmasters tweaking pages on their local hard drive in an effort to unlock any insight in Google's algorithm that can be applied to their sites.  </p>
