selected resources and to remove the category from the selected resources.

To install the plugin, unpack it to the Omea installation directory, go to 
Tools | Options | Omea | Plugins, click on "Add..." and select the 
CategoryHotkeys.dll file. Then restart Omea.

To use the plugin, right-click any category and select "Assign Hotkeys..." from 
the context menu. Press the keys you would like to use as hotkeys and click
OK to save the hotkeys.

The complete C# source code of the plugin is included. You may use portions of
the source code in your plugins.
