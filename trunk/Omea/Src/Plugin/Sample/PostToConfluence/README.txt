======================================

Copyright (C) 2004-05, JetBrains Inc.


This sample plugin for Omea Pro 1.0, Omea Reader 1.0.2 and later versions
allows you to publish the text of Omea resources in Confluence. Confluence 
is a wiki and weblog tool developed by Atlassian:
http://www.atlassian.com/software/confluence/

To install the plugin, unpack it to the Omea installation directory, go to 
Tools | Options | Omea | Plugins, click on "Add..." and select the 
CategoryHotkeys.dll file. Then restart Omea.

To use the plugin, select any resource in Omea and select 
"Post to Confluence..." from the Actions menu. Specify the address of the 
Confluence Web site, your login and password. After a successful login,
you can choose the Confluence space where the page with the resource text
is posted and the mode of posting the resource. The resource can be posted
either as a blog post or as a new page. If the resource is posted as a new
page, you can select a parent page for that page.

You can also edit the title and text of the page that will be posted.

The complete C# source code of the plugin is included. You may use portions of
the source code in your plugins.
