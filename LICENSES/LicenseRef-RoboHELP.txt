Replaced Software and Documentation shall be covered by this limited warranty for the period remaining under the warranty that covered the original Software, or if longer, for thirty (30) days after the date of shipment to you of the replaced Software. Only if you inform eHelp of such defect with the Software during the applicable warranty period and provide evidence of the date you acquired the Software will eHelp be obligated to honor this warranty. eHelp will use commercially reasonable efforts to replace or refund pursuant to the foregoing warranty within thirty (30) days of being so notified. THIS IS A LIMITED WARRANTY AND IT IS THE ONLY WARRANTY MADE BY EHELP. EXCEPT FOR THE LIMITED WARRANTY SET FORTH HEREIN, THE SOFTWARE AND DOCUMENTATION ARE PROVIDED "AS IS" AND EHELP MAKES NO OTHER WARRANTY, REPRESENTATION, OR CONDITION, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, OR STATUTORY,  AND EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NONINFRINGEMENT OF THIRD PARTY RIGHTS.  SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW LIMITATIONS ON HOW LONG AN IMPLIED WARRANTY OR CONDITION LASTS, SO THESE LIMITATIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU IN THEIR ENTIRETY.

This warranty shall not apply if the Software is used on or in conjunction with hardware or software other than the unmodified version of hardware and software with which the Software was designed to be used as described in the Documentation.  THIS WARRANTY GIVES YOU SPECIFIC LEGAL RIGHTS, AND YOU MAY HAVE OTHER LEGAL RIGHTS THAT VARY FROM STATE TO STATE OR BY JURISDICTION.

IN NO EVENT SHALL THE AGGREGATE LIABILITY OF EHELP, ITS SUPPLIERS AND RESELLERS UNDER THIS AGREEMENT EXCEED EHELP'S LIST PRICE FOR A LICENSE TO THE SOFTWARE AND DOCUMENTATION. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION.
