<h1 align="center">Omea Open API and Plugin Development Kit</h1>
<h2 align="center">version 2.0, 6 Sep 2005</h2>
<h2>Archive Contents</h2>
<p>This archive includes a set of documents, tools and sample code which will
allow you to start developing Omea plugins. The archive includes:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Omea OpenAPI.chm, a generated CHM help file for the Omea Open API
	assembly;</li>
	<li><a href="OmeaPluginTutorial.html">OmeaPluginTutorial.html</a>, a
	tutorial describing the development of an Omea plugin;</li>
	<li>SamplePlugins\Dictionary, a minimal sample plugin for Omea implementing
	a trivial action;</li>
	<li>SamplePlugins\Librarian, a sample plugin described in the tutorial;</li>
	<li>SamplePlugins\BloglinesPlugin, a sample plugin which allows to import
	the list of feed subscriptions from Bloglines.com;</li>
	<li>SamplePlugins\LiveJournalPlugin, a sample plugin which allows to import
	the list of a user's LiveJournal friends as RSS subscriptions in Omea;</li>
	<li>SamplePlugins\CategoryHotkeys, a sample plugin which allows to register
	hotkeys for assigning categories to resources;</li>
	<li>SamplePlugins\PostToConfluence, a sample plugin which allows to post the
	text of the selected resource as a page or blog post in
	<a href="http://www.atlassian.com/confluence/">Atlassian Confluence</a>;</li>
	<li>DebugPlugin.dll, a plugin which provides several functions useful for
	Omea plugin developers.</li>
</ul>
<p>The APIs described in the CHM file are valid for Omea Pro and Omea Reader version
2.0. The new API elements which have been added in the version 2.0 are labeled as
such in the CHM file. The majority of the API is compatible between versions 1.0 and 2.0,
but a number of rarely used or improperly designed APIs were removed in the version 2.0,
so some of the plugins developed for version 1.0 may not be compatible with the version 2.0.</p>
<h2>Browsing the Omea Database</h2>
<p>We do not provide complete documentation on the resource types and property
types used by Omea and its standard plugins. Instead, we provide a tool which
lets you browse all the resources in your Omea resource store and all their
properties and links.</p>
<p>A small introduction to the Omea data model can be found in
<a href="http://blogs.jetbrains.com/yole/archives/000014.html">this blog post</a>.</p>
<p>In order to use the resource store browser, you will first need to install
the debug plugin. The plugin (DebugPlugin.dll) is included in the Open API
archive. You can install it from the Tools / Options / Omea / Plugins option
page.</p>
<p>After you add the plugin and restart Omea, you will see a new menu &quot;Debug&quot; in
the main menu. The first item in that menu, &quot;Browse Resources...&quot;, will open the
resource browser. It shows the list of all resource types on the left and the
list of resources of each type to the right. Double-clicking a resource opens
the window for viewing its properties.</p>
<p>You can also view the properties of a specific resource by right-clicking it
and selecting &quot;Show Properties...&quot; from the context menu.</p>
<p>If you check &quot;Show links&quot; in the properties dialog, you will see links from
the resource to other resources. Double-clicking the link will open the linked
resource.</p>
