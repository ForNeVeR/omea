<h1>Feeds</h1>

<p class=opt>You can access this option from the Main menu: <strong>Tools 
 | Options: Internet: Feeds</strong></p>

<p><span style="x-condition: READER;">Omea Reader</span><span style="x-condition: PRO;">Omea 
 Pro</span> supports both RSS and Atom feeds. This page of the <a href="options_dialog.html">Options 
 dialog</a> provides options for controlling how <span style="x-condition: READER;">Omea 
 Reader</span><span style="x-condition: PRO;">Omea Pro</span> interoperates 
 with feeds.</p>

<p class=caption>Feeds options in the Options Dialog</p>

<h3>Default Feed Update Interval</h3>

<p>This option enables you to specify how often <span style="x-condition: READER;">Omea 
 Reader</span><span style="x-condition: PRO;">Omea Pro</span> should update 
 the feeds you are subscribed to. Please note that if you are not subscribed 
 to any feeds, this setting has no effect.</p>

<p>The option has two controls placed left-to-right.</p>

<ul>
	
	<li class=kadov-p>The first holds a <strong>number</strong> that indicates 
 how many units of time between updates. The minimum value is <strong>1</strong>; 
 the maximum value is <strong>1000</strong>. </li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p>The second is a drop-down list that provides a choice 
 of units of time: <strong>minutes, hours</strong>, <strong>days</strong>, <strong>weeks</strong> or <strong>years</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<p>For example, if you want your feeds updated once daily:</p>

<ol>
	
	<li class=kadov-p>Enter <strong>1</strong> in the first control’s edit 
 box.</li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p>Select <strong>days</strong> in the drop-down list.</li>
</ol>

<div class=tip>
<div class=tipImg
	style="/*begin!kadov{{*/ x-right: 747px; x-bottom: 776px; /*}}end!kadov*/ ">
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
        </div>
<p class=tip>You can either enter a number between 1 and 1000 in the number 
 box, or use the &quot;spin&quot; buttons to ratchet the value upwards 
 or downwards in intervals of 1.</p>
</div>

<h3>Stop Updating Feed Comments&#8230;</h3>
<p>This option allows you to control when the feed comments (replicas to the feed post)  stop updating. Omea will not update the comments in feeds if comments stop appearing after the period of time which you specify here using the spinner to set the number (<span class="kadov-p">that indicates how many units of time between appearing the new comments </span>) and a drop-down list to select the time unit (<span class="kadov-p"><strong>minutes, hours</strong>, <strong>days</strong>, <strong>weeks</strong> or <strong>years</strong></span>).</p>
<h3>Feeds Update Timeout</h3>
<p>In some cases your feeds may stop updating because of some problems which take place on the feed server side for example. Timeout in general is a period of time after which an error condition is raised if 
      some event has not occurred. In case of feeds the update timeout is a period after which information transmission error is 
      assumed to have occurred. You can change this setting in Omea setting the time of this option control. </p>
<a name="usecookies"></a>
<h3>Use Cookies of&#8230; </h3>
<p>Select one option from the drop-down list to tell Omea which Internet browser cookies you want it to use. </p>
<p>Cookies is a collection of information (usually including a username and the current date and time, stored on the local computer) used to identify users who have previously registered or visited the site. </p>
<p>The options available in the drop-down list derive from the web browsers you use (each web browser has its own cookies settings) and user profiles which you have in your browsers. You can also tell Omea not to use any cookies (select None from the drop-down list). </p>
<h4>Setting the update interval for individual feeds</h4>
<p>To change the update interval for a specific feed, you can select it 
 in the Feeds pane, right-click, choose <strong>Properties</strong> from 
 the context menu. The Feed Properties dialog appears and you can set the 
 interval for this selected feed there. </p>

<p><span class=label>If <strong>Remember selection in feeds between restarts</strong></span> 
 checkbox is a selected, <span style="x-condition: READER;">Omea Reader</span><span 
 style="x-condition: PRO;">Omea Pro</span> will  remember the selected 
 item in RSS feeds between its restarts.</p>

<p><span class=label>If <strong>Show a desktop alert when new items are 
 received</strong></span> checkbox is selected, it shows a notification 
 of any RSS item received by <span style="x-condition: READER;">Omea Reader</span><span 
 style="x-condition: PRO;">Omea Pro</span>. You may find this option very useful in your daily work. </p>
<p>If <strong>In Newspaper View, select items when I point at them</strong> checkbox is selected, the feed posts you are browsing in Newspaper View are selected automatically when you place the mouse pointer over the feed post. </p>
<h2>Weblog Posting Extensions</h2>

<p>The controls here enable you to manage the installation of weblog posting 
 extensions.</p>

<p><span style="x-condition: READER;">Omea Reader</span><span style="x-condition: PRO;">Omea 
 Pro</span> supports third-party weblog posting extensions which enable 
 you to post replies to comments to a weblog from within <span style="x-condition: READER;">Omea 
 Reader</span> <span style="x-condition: PRO;">Omea Pro</span>. Posting 
 extensions are typically Dynamic Link Library (DLL) files.</p>

<p>After you install a weblog posting extension, an item named <em>Blog 
 This</em> appears on the main Action<!-- TO DO: Verify menu --> menu and 
 on the context menu of RSS feed posts in the Feeds resource list. Each 
 installed weblog posting extension appears as a submenu item, enabling 
 you to choose which extension to use to post a reply to the weblog.</p>
<div class=indent>
<h3>Posting Extensions List</h3>

<p>This list displays the weblog posting extensions currently installed. 
 The list has 2 columns: </p>

<ul>
	
	<li class=kadov-p><strong style="font-weight: bold;">Title</strong>: 
 Shows the name/title of the extension as defined in the extension’s DLL 
 file.</li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p><strong style="font-weight: bold;">File Name</strong>: 
 Shows the path and file name of the DLL file for the selected posting 
 extension.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Install (button)</h3>

<p>Enables installation of a new weblog posting extension. Launches a file 
 selection dialog that enables you to navigate to and select the DLL file 
 for the extension.</p>

<h3>Configure (button)</h3>

<p>Launches a dialog enabling you configure the currently selected weblog 
 posting extension. Button is disabled if no extension is selected or there 
 are no extensions in the list.</p>

<h3>Uninstall (button)</h3>

<p>The button removes the selected weblog client extension from <span style="x-condition: READER;">Omea 
 Reader</span> <span style="x-condition: PRO;">Omea Pro</span>. The extension 
 files are not removed from the hard disk. You can reinstall the extension 
 later using the <em>Install</em> button.</p>
<h2>Autoexpiration Rules</h2>
<p>This group of options will allow you to control the settings when Omea can consider the feeds posts &#8220;old&#8221; or outdated  and actions which you want <span style="x-condition: READER;">Omea 
 Reader</span> <span style="x-condition: PRO;">Omea Pro</span> to perform with these outdated feed posts. Once you customize these options, you will manage to avoid the information clutter and always have latest and the most important information in your feed subscription. You can later edit these default expiration rules and define the per feed expiration rules (conditions, exceptions and actions) in the <a href="manage_rules.html">Rules Manager</a>.</p>

 Reader</span><span style="x-condition: PRO;">Omea Pro</span> will do with the feeds which it considers&#8220;old&#8221;. By default, these feeds are deleted but you can change this action if you specify something else in the <a href="auto_expiration_rule_dialog.htm">Edit Expiration Rule dialog</a> which appears if you click the <strong>Advanced</strong> button and specify other actions in it.</p>
