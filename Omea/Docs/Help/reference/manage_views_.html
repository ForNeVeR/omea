<h1>Views Manager Dialog</h1>

<p class=opt>You can access this dialog from the main menu: <strong>Tools 
 | Views Manager</strong> or <span class=kadov-p>right-click any item in 
 the <strong>Views and Categories</strong> pane and choose <em>Views Manager</em> 
 on the context menu</span></p>

<p>This dialog is a point which provides you with central control on Views; 
 you can create new Views, edit the criteria of existing Views (including 
 the default Views which exist in <span style="x-condition: READER;">Omea 
 Reader</span><span style="x-condition: PRO;">Omea Pro</span>), copy and 
 delete existing Views, and create View Folders. The dialog lists all of 
 the currently defined Views.</p>

<p>For more information about Views, see <a href="../organizing/organizing_using_views.html">Organizing 
 Using Views</a>.</p>

<h2>Dialog Components</h2>

<h3>Available Views Tabs </h3>

<p>Shows all currently defined Views grouped in tabs — <strong>General</strong>, 
 <strong>Contacts</strong><span style="x-condition: PRO;">, and <strong>Tasks</strong></span>.</p>

<p>Click the appropriate tab and select a View to edit, copy or delete 
 it. Or create a new folder to add the existing or new Views to it. </p>

<div class=note>

<div class="noteImg"
	style="/*begin!kadov{{*/ x-right: 944px; x-bottom: 3017px; /*}}end!kadov*/ ">
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
  </div>
<p class=note>Please note that the Views and View Folders you create and 
 existing Views are visible in all Workspaces you have in <span style="x-condition: READER;">Omea 
 Reader</span><span style="x-condition: PRO;">Omea Pro</span>. </p>
</div>

<h4>General Tab </h4>

<p>Contains a list of basic types of Views. These are recent Views, Clippings, 
 Flagged, Annotated and Categorized Views and Deleted Resources. </p>

<h4>Contacts Tab</h4>

<p>Contains a list of available Views for Contacts. By default, it contains 
 <em>All</em> and <em>Active</em> Views for Contacts but you may create 
 a View for your ICQ or Miranda Contacts or other Views. To do so, create 
 a new View and specify <em>Contact is in ICQ Contacts</em> as a condition 
 (Click <strong>Add</strong>, select <em>Contact is in Address Book</em>, 
 click the <em>address book</em> hyperlink and select <em>ICQ Contacts</em>). 
 </p>

<h4 style="x-condition: PRO;">Tasks Tab</h4>

<p style="x-condition: PRO;">Contains a list of available Views which will 
 allow you to view your tasks based on some specific criteria, but you 
 can also create the Views for Tasks which correspond to your own needs. 
 Say these can be Views for tasks which you have different priority (high, 
 normal, low) or you can create a View called “Tasks this month ” which 
 will contain all tasks you have to fulfill during the current month. </p>

<h3>Dialog Buttons</h3>

<h4>New View</h4>

<p>Launches the New View dialog in which you can define the search conditions 
 and exceptions for a new View.</p>

<h4>New Folder</h4>

<p>Launches the <strong>Enter Name of a View</strong> folder dialog where 
 you need to specify the folder name. Once you have created a new View 
 Folder, you can either create new Views in it or drag the existing Views 
 and drop it into the View Folder. </p>

<h4>Edit</h4>

<p>Launches the Edit View dialog in which you can add, delete, or modify 
 the search conditions and exceptions for the View currently selected in 
 the Available Views list.</p>

<h4>Copy View</h4>

<p>Creates a copy of the currently selected View. Use this possibility 
 to copy your Views and then edit them without need to specify conditions 
 and exceptions from the scratch.</p>

<p style="x-condition: READER;">For example, you have a View for a certain 
 newsgroup which shows items which appeared in this very newsgroup Today
