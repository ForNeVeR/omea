	<h1>Workspaces Dialog</h1>
	<p>This dialog enables you to define new Workspaces, modify the already existing Workspaces, and specify what resources appear when you
	work in each workspace.</p>

	<div style="x-condition: PRO;">
       <p><img src="../images/sshots/dialogs/pro/workspaces_dialog.png" width="739" height="442" alt="Workspaces dialog" /></p>

       <p class="caption">The Workspaces dialog</p>
	</div>

	<h2>Workspaces Pane</h2>
	<p>This pane at the left side of the dialog shows a list of your current Workspaces. It has controls
	creating a new Workspace, and renaming or deleting an existing Workspace and change the order of the already existing Workspaces.</p>

	 <p>The list is empty until you create a new Workspace. The name of the currently selected Workspace
	 appears highlighted.</p>

	 <p>You can resize the pane horizontally using the splitter.</p>
	 <p>To change the order of the existing Workspaces, select the desired Workspace and click either  <img src="../images/iconsMarks/ico_wsp_up.png" width="12" height="11" class="linkIcon" /> or <img src="../images/iconsMarks/ico_wsp_down.png" width="12" height="11" class="linkIcon" />  to move the Workspace up or down (respectively) in the list of Workspaces. As you do it, the order of the Workspaces in the <strong>Workspaces bar</strong> also changes. </p>
	 <h3>Context Menu</h3>
	<p>The Workspaces list has a context menu when a Workspace name is selected. The menu enables you to
	rename the selected Workspace or delete it.</p>
	<div class="tip">
	    <p class="tip">You can also rename a Workspace &quot;in place&quot; by clicking on then name
		after it is selected and editing the name in the editable text box that appears.</p>
  </div>

	<h3>New Button</h3>
	<p>Creates a new Workspace. You are prompted to enter a name for the new Workspace.</p>

   <h3>Rename Button</h3>
	<p>This button enables you to rename the Workspace currently selected in the Workspaces list. The
	button is disabled if no Workspace is selected, or if the Workspaces list is empty. The context
	menu on the Workspaces list provides the same functionality.</p>

	<h3>Delete Button</h3>
	<p>This button deletes the Workspace currently selected in the Workspaces list. The button is
	disabled if no Workspace is selected, or if the Workspaces list is empty. The context menu on the
	Workspaces list provides the same functionality.</p>

          <p>&nbsp;</p>
        </div>
<p class=tip>You can change the order of workspaces in the Worskpaces Bar using <strong>Up</strong>
and <strong>Down</strong> arrows. Location changes will be immediately reflected on the Workspace Bar.</p>
</div>
	<h2>Workspace Resources Pane</h2>
	<p>The right-hand pane of the dialog contains a set of tabbed pages corresponding to different
	kinds of <a href="../overview/key_concepts.html#resources">resources</a>. In each of these tabs
	you can specify which resources you want to see in the currently selected Workspace. You can pick
	from among all the indexed resources currently available to <span style="x-condition: READER;">Omea Reader</span>
	<span style="x-condition: PRO;">Omea Pro</span> by default and by your settings in the
	<a href="options_dialog.html">Options dialog</a>.</p>

	<p>Each of the tabs has the same basic contents:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>A list showing all available resources of the type corresponding to the selected tab</li>

		<li>A list showing only the resources (of the type corresponding to the selected tab) that appear
		in the current Workspace</li>

		<li>A set of button controls for adding and removing resources from the list of resource for
		the current Workspace.</li>

		<li>A list of individual resources (e-mail messages or feed postings, for example) that have
		been added to the Workspace.</li>
	</ul>

    <h3>Available (list)</h3>

	<h3>Add Button</h3>
	<p>Available for all resource types, the button adds selected resource(s) in the <em>Available</em>
	list to the <em>In Workspace</em> list. The button is disable if there are no available resources
	to add to the Workspace.</p>

	<p>For resources<span style="x-condition: PRO;"> such as E-mail and Files</span> that can contain sub-folders,
	this button adds <em>only</em> the selected folder... no sub-folders are added even if they exist.</p>

	<h3>Add Subtree Button</h3>
	<p>Similar to the Add button, except that for resources<span style="x-condition: PRO;"> such as E-mail and Files</span>
	than can contain sub-folders, this button adds <em>both</em> the selected folder <em>and</em> any sub-folders
	it may contain, down to the lowest level.</p>

	<p>Available (visible) in all resource tabs <em>except</em>:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Contacts</li>
		<li style="x-condition: PRO;">Tasks</li>
		<li>E-mail Account</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>Remove Button</h3>
	<p>Removes selected resource(s) from the <em>In Workspace</em> list, thus removing then from the
	currently selected Workspace. No resources are deleted from disk, and all such removed resources
	still exist in <span style="x-condition: READER;">Omea Reader</span><span style="x-condition: PRO;">Omea Pro</span>
	in the default &quot;All&quot; Workspace.</p>
    <a name=other></a>
	<h3>Other</h3>
	<p>This view presents a list of individual resources (<span style="x-condition: PRO;">e-mail messages or </span>
	feed postings, for example) that have been added to the Workspace via the main window... by dragging and dropping
	onto the Workspace&#039;s selector button, for example.</p>

	<div style="x-condition: PRO;">
	   <img src="../images/sshots/pro/workspace_dialog_other.png" width="480" height="176" alt="Other resources in Workspace" />
		<p class="caption">Other shows items that have been added to the Workspace in the main window. Here, it shows some files that were added.</p>
	</div>

	<p>When you first create a new Workspace, it&#039;s normal for this view to be empty. Later, if you
	make changes to a Workspace and some items are listed here, you can use the <strong>Remove</strong>
	button to remove them from the Workspace.</p>
	<h3>Color Area </h3>
	<p><span class="kadov-p">Allows you to select the Workspace color and preview it.  As you click  different places of the color selector, you can preview the resulting color in a small square at the left from the color selector. <br />
To select a different color than the one available of the color selector area, click <strong>Other</strong>&#8230;. In the <strong>Color</strong> window which opens, select the desired color in the <strong>Basic colors</strong> list or define a <em>Custom</em> color.

	default &quot;All&quot; Workspace.</p>
