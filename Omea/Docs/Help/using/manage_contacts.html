<h1>Contacts in <span style="x-condition: READER;">Omea Reader</span><span
 style="x-condition: PRO;">Omea Pro</span></h1>

<p>You can access the Contacts in the <strong>Contacts</strong> tab or in the <em>Correspondents pane</em> (press <strong>Ctrl+Alt+C</strong>) . If you click on the
 tab, you will see the list with the names and e-mail addresses of everyone
 who has posted to the newsgroups to which you are subscribed. This is
 because <span style="x-condition: READER;">Omea Reader</span><span style="x-condition: PRO;">Omea
 Pro</span> indexes all resources and information about them is used to
 support posting and replying to newsgroup articles.</p>

<h2>E-mail Accounts in Omea </h2>
<p>You have probably come across the concept of e-mail accounts when configuring MS Outlook.  You can usually get the e-mail service you need by adding an e-mail account to Microsoft Outlook. Depending on your needs, you can add several e-mail accounts to a single Outlook user profile. Once you install Omea Pro and enable Outlook Plugin, Omea takes your e-mail account information from the Sent Items available in Outlook. You can change your the e-mail accounts  in <a href="../reference/user_info.html">Tools: Options: Omea: User Information</a>. </p>
<h3>Sending E-mail to Contacts</h3>
<p>If the contact's record contains an e-mail address, it appears as a link on <strong>the Links Bar</strong>, in the <strong>Links and Actions</strong> panel, and in the detail in the <strong>Item Viewer</strong>. You can click any such link to send e-mail to the contact.</p>
<h3>Linking to Relevant Content</h3>
<p>A useful feature of Contacts in <span style="x-condition: READER;">Omea Reader</span><span style="x-condition: PRO;">Omea Pro</span> is the linking. When you select a contact in the <strong>Contacts</strong> tab, a summary of all his/her posts appears in the <strong>Links and Actions</strong> panel, along with a link to each post.</p>
<h1>Managing Contacts</h1>
<p style="x-condition: PRO;">Omea Pro has a number of contact management
 features, including integration with MS Outlook contacts. The contacts
 from your Outlook address book(s) are immediately available in Omea Pro
 (unless you specify otherwise in the Outlook Address Books options. See
 <a href="#options">Relevant Options Settings</a>, below). If you use ICQ
 instant messenger or Miranda, your ICQ and Miranda contacts are also available.</p>
<p style="x-condition: PRO;">As resource arrives
   from different sources (e-mail, newsgroups, instant messages), new contact
   records are automatically created in Omea Pro if no contact record already
   exists. Omea Pro compares only the name and e-mail address of incoming
   resources to determine if it should create a new Contact record. So for
   example, when a newsgroup article downloads, Omea Pro will create a contact
   record for the author derived from the newsgroup contact data for that
   person (which will be just a name and an e-mail address) if no matching
   name + e-mail address exists in the database.</p>
<a name=viewing></a>

<h2>Viewing Contacts</h2>

<p>You can view your contacts in the Contacts tab of the main window. <span
 style="x-condition: PRO;">When you select this tab, the Address Books
 pane is available in the left sidebar. By default, this pane shows the
 address books automatically imported from MS Outlook and, if you use them,
 the supported instant messaging programs (currently ICQ and Miranda).
 </span>The Views and Categories pane contains a special View for Contacts
 called <em>Active</em> (see <a href="#active">Active View</a>, below).</p>

<h3 style="x-condition: PRO;">How the Address Books Appear in Omea</h3>
<p style="x-condition: PRO;">Once you have come through the startup wizard and checked the Address Books which you want to be available in Omea, these Address Books appear in Omea. You can later change the Address Books in Tools: Options: MS Outlook: Outlook Address Books. </p>
<p style="x-condition: PRO;">As for Mozilla and ICQ Address Books, address books for <strong>ICQ Contacts</strong> and <strong>Miranda Contacts</strong> appear in the <strong>Address Books</strong> pane of the <strong>Contacts</strong> tab once you have told Omea to index the history of some <a href="../reference/icq.html">ICQ account </a> or <a href="../reference/miranda.html">Miranda profile</a> which you have.</p>
<div class="note">
  <div class="noteImg"
	style="/*begin!kadov{{*/ x-right: 944px; x-bottom: 3017px; /*}}end!kadov*/ ">
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
  </div>
  <p class="note">Please note that you cannot delete contacts from Address Books which are listed in Address Books with <img src="../images/iconsMarks/ico_address_book.png" width="16" height="16" class="linkIcon"> icon. </p>
</div>
<h3 style="x-condition: PRO;">Listing Contacts in Address Books</h3>
<p style="x-condition: PRO;">When you select an address book in the <strong>Address
 Books</strong> pane, the contacts it contains appear in the <strong>Items List</strong>. </p>

<h3>Listing Contacts Using Views</h3>

<p>As with other resource types, you can select one of the default Views
 in the <strong>Views and Categories</strong> pane to list only those Contacts that meet
 the View’s selection criteria. (If the list of Contacts in the <strong> Items List</strong> is empty, it means no Contacts match the selection criteria.)</p>

<a name=active></a>

<h4>The Active View</h4>

<p>There is a special View for Contacts called <em>Active</em>. This View
 selects Contacts with whom you have corresponded (i.e. either sent messages
 to or received messages from) within a specified period of time. The default
 time period for Active Contacts is the past 30 days. You can edit the
 View to specify a longer of shorter period for Contacts you want to be
 considered as &quot;active&quot;. (For more information, see <a href="../organizing/organizing_using_views.html#modifying">Modifying
 an Existing View</a>.)</p>
<div class="note">
  <div class="noteImg"
	style="/*begin!kadov{{*/ x-right: 944px; x-bottom: 3017px; /*}}end!kadov*/ ">
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
  </div>
  <p class="note">The <em>All</em> View includes not just the contacts you have corresponded with, but also everyone who has posted to any of the newsgroups and feeds  you are subscribed to and sent you e-mail messages. That's potentially a very long list. You may prefer to use the <a href="../search/index.html">Search features</a> to locate a specific contact, or other Views that narrow down the listing. You can of course <a href="../organizing/organizing_using_views.html#custom">create new Views</a> for your Contacts if you like.</p>
</div>
<h3 style="x-condition: PRO;">Listing Contacts Using Categories</h3>

<p style="x-condition: PRO;">As with other resource types, you can &quot;file&quot;
 Contacts in your <a href="../organizing/organizing_using_categories.html">Categories</a>
 (see Organizing Contacts, below). When you select a Category in the Views
 and Categories pane, only those Contacts filed in the selected Category
 appear in the list of Contacts (Items List).</p>

<h3>Browsing Contacts</h3>

<p>When you select an Address Book or a View, the relevant Contacts are
 listed in the Items List. By default, the list contains columns for Display
 Name, E-mail Address, Flag, and Annotation, and the Contacts are listed
 sorted alphabetically by Display Name. You can change the sorting of the
 list by clicking on a column header to sort the list according to the
 selected column.</p>

<p>You can select an individual Contact record by clicking on it in the
 list. You can use the Up and Down arrow keys to scroll through the list
 of Contacts when the list has focus. When you select a Contact, all details
 appear in the Item Viewer. When you open the Links &amp; Actions panel,
 you will find links to all the resources sent to and received from the
 selected Contact. You can use the button in the detail view to edit the
 details for the selected contact.</p>

<h2><span style="x-condition: PRO;">Creating and </span>Modifying Contacts</h2>

<p>You can <span style="x-condition: PRO;">create new Contacts in Omea
 Pro, and </span>modify <span style="x-condition: PRO;">(edit and delete)
 </span><!--kadov_tag{{<spaces>}}-->&nbsp;<!--kadov_tag{{</spaces>}}-->the
 details of existing Contacts in <span style="x-condition: PRO;">Omea Pro</span><span
 style="x-condition: READER;">Omea Reader</span>. <span style="x-condition: PRO;">If
 you create new Contacts, or modify or delete existing Contacts in an Outlook
 address book, the changes are synchronized with Outlook.</span></p>

<p style="x-condition: PRO;">You can also create custom address books.
 Contacts you create in these are maintained only in Omea Pro and are not
 synchronized with Outlook. It is not necessary to associate new Contacts
 with any address book. Such unassociated Contacts appear in the list of
 Contacts when you select the View named <em>All</em> in the <strong>Views and
 Categories</strong> pane. You can also search for unassociated Contacts or create
 Views with appropriate search criteria to access them. Until you are well
 acquainted with these features of Omea Pro, you should probably create
 new Contacts in some <strong>Address Book</strong>.</p>

 all of the messages, articles, etc. for such a Contact, <span style="x-condition: PRO;">Omea
 Pro</span><span style="x-condition: READER;">Omea Reader</span> will delete
 the contact record. Again, this applies <em>only</em> to auto-created
 contact records. <span style="x-condition: PRO;">Omea Pro</span><span
 style="x-condition: READER;">Omea Reader</span> will <em>never</em> delete
 contact records that were explicitly created by you,<span style="x-condition: PRO;">
 or imported from MS Outlook or an instant messaging application,</span>
 even if you should delete all the messages and other resources associated
 with them. It is up to you to delete such Contacts.</p>

<h2>Merging Contacts</h2>

<p><span style="x-condition: PRO;">Omea Pro</span><span style="x-condition: READER;">Omea
 Reader</span> automatically creates Contact records for senders of incoming
 resources and recipients of resources you send out if there is no matching
 Contact record for them in the database. This can lead to multiple Contact
 records for the same person. For example, someone may have sent you an
 e-mail from their work address, while you have previously sent e-mails
 to him/her using a personal e-mail address. In this case separate Contact
 records will be created only when Contacts have different names in <span
 style="x-condition: PRO;">Omea Pro</span><span style="x-condition: READER;">Omea
 Reader</span>. <span style="x-condition: PRO;">Furthermore, the same person
 may have sent you instant messages from an ICQ account that has a different
 name (a nickname, for example). The result is 3 contact records for the
 same person.</span></p>

<p>This is a fairly normal scenario, and it presents no problems for the
 computer. However, you will probably prefer to deal with a single Contact
 record for the same person that encompasses all the names and e-mail addresses
 he or she might use in cyberspace. Therefore, <span style="x-condition: PRO;">Omea
 Pro</span><span style="x-condition: READER;">Omea Reader</span> provides
 the <strong>Merge Contacts</strong> feature that you can use to consolidate
 multiple Contact records for the same person into a single record.</p>

<h3>How to Tell if There are Contacts that Can be Merged</h3>

<p style="x-condition: PRO;">Oftentimes you will simply know in the course
 of your work in Omea Pro that you have multiple Contact records for the
 same person. For example, suppose you have an imported Outlook Contact
 record for your friend Kay which has her name as &quot;Kay Sarrah&quot;.
 Then Kay sends you an ICQ message and you realize that you have an ICQ
 contact record for her ICQ handle &quot;MegaKate&quot;. When that happens
 you can go ahead and use Merge Contacts so in the future you only need
 to deal with one Contact record for Kay.</p>

<p>You may not always realize when you have multiple contacts for the same
 person. For example, you may have an e-mail contact for an employee named
 &quot;Tom Kat&quot;. Unbeknownst to you, Tom posts an article on a newsgroup
 you subscribe to using the nickname &quot;TomTheCat&quot;, but the same
 e-mail address. This results in a second Contact record for Tom. <span
 style="x-condition: PRO;">Omea Pro</span><span style="x-condition: READER;">Omea
 Reader</span> has some logic built in to try to guess when multiple Contacts
 may be for one person and suggest them to you as candidates for merging.
 In this case, next time you access Tom’s Contact record you would see
 that there is one Contact that seems to be a candidate for merging. You
 can review the suggestions in the <strong>Merge Contacts</strong> dialog and decide to
 merge the Contacts or not. Ultimately, the decision that multiple Contact
 records indeed pertain to the same person, and which ones to merge, is
 up to you. </p>

<h3>How to Merge Contacts</h3>

<p>Once you have identified that some Contact records are indeed for the
 same person, you can Merge them using the Merge Contacts dialog. </p>

<p class=caption>The Merge Contacts dialog showing one Contact suggested
 for merging.</p>

<div class=proc>
<p class=procHead>To merge contacts:</p>

<ol>

	<li class=kadov-p><p>Locate one of the Contact records that is to be
 merged and select it in the Items List and in the Item Viewer, which now
 shows the Contact’s details, click the <strong>Merge</strong> button.
 Or select two or more Contact records of the same person by holding <strong>Ctrl</strong>
 button and clicking on the Contacts you want to merge, and on the context
 menu, choose <strong>Merge Contacts…</strong><br>
	The <strong>Merge Contacts</strong> dialog appears.</p></li>

	<li class=kadov-p><p>If one or more Contacts appears in the <em>Suggested</em>
 list on the left, review each one and decide which, if any, are for the
 same person as the one(s) that appear in the <em>Contacts to Merge</em>
 list on the right.<br />
	<br />
	Select the <em>Suggested</em> Contacts you want to merge and click
 the <strong>Add</strong> button. The selected Contact(s) move to the right
 hand list, which shows all the Contacts that will be merged as a result
 of the operation. </p></li>

	<li class=kadov-p><p>If there are no Contacts in the <em>Suggested</em>
 list but you know that another contact record exists for the same person,
 click the <strong>More Contacts</strong> button. In the Select Contact(s)
 dialog, check the box for each Contact you want to merge, then click <strong>OK</strong>.
 The Contact(s) you checked now appear in the list of Contacts to be merged.</p></li>

	<li class=kadov-p><p>In the <em>Contacts to Merge</em> list, select
 the Contact with the name you want to have displayed for the merged contact
 record. That name appears in the <em>Merged Contact Name</em> field.</p></li>

	<li class=kadov-p><p>If you want messages to and from the merged contacts
 to display the name they were sent under (as opposed to the name selected
 in the previous step), check the box for <em>Use original names in messages</em>.</p></li>

	<li class=kadov-p><p>Click the <strong>Merge</strong> button to complete
 the operation and merge all of the Contacts in the <em>Contacts to Merge</em>
 list.</p></li>
</ol>
</div>

<a name=extracting></a>

<h3>Extracting Merged Contacts</h3>

<p>Merge Contacts does not wipe out the original Contact records. It simply
 aggregates the data from all of them and causes <span style="x-condition: PRO;">Omea
 Pro</span><span style="x-condition: READER;">OmeaReader</span> to present
 it all together it under a single name. Therefore, if you make a mistake
 when merging Contacts, or if later on you decide you prefer to work with
 multiple Contact records for one person, you can revert to the original
 contact records using the <strong>Extract Merged Contacts</strong> feature. If more than
 two Contacts were merged, you can extract all into separate records, or
 just some of them.</p>

<p>You can tell if a Contact has been merged by looking at its detail.
 If the selected Contact has been merged, a field <em>Available Names</em>
 appears in the detail listing all the Contact names that have been merged.</p>

<div class=proc>
<p class=procHead>To extract Contact(s) from a merged Contact:</p>

<ol>

	<li class=kadov-p><p>Select the contact in the <strong>Items List</strong>.</p></li>

	<li class=kadov-p>
	<p>Right-click and choose <strong>Extract Merged Contact(s)</strong>
 on the context menu.<br>
 The <strong>Extract Merged Contacts</strong> dialog appears.<br />

<h3 style="x-condition: PRO;">Moving Contacts Between Address Books</h3>

<p style="x-condition: PRO;">You can move Contacts between Address Books,
 or if a Contact is not associated with any Address Book, you can move
 it into one.</p>

<div class=proc
	style="x-condition: PRO;">
<p class=procHead>To move a Contact to an Address Book:</p>

<ol>

	<li class=kadov-p>Make sure you are in the <strong>Contacts</strong> tab... switch tabs
 if necessary.</li>

	<li class=kadov-p>If the <strong>Address Books</strong> pane is not visible in the left
 sidebar, click the sidebar button to show it.</li>

	<li class=kadov-p>Locate the Contact you want to move by browsing or
 searching as described earlier in this topic.</li>

	<li class=kadov-p>Select the Contact in the listing of Contacts (<strong>Items
 List</strong>).</li>

	<li class=kadov-p>Drag the Contact and drop it into the desired <strong>Address
 Book</strong> in the <strong>Address Books</strong> pane.</li>
</ol>
</div>

<h3>Contacts and Workspaces</h3>

<p>When you define custom <a href="../organizing/organizing_using_workspaces.html">Workspaces</a>,
 you can associate a subset of all your Contacts with that Workspace. Then,
 when you work in a particular Workspace, you will only see and deal with
 the contacts for that Workspace. For example, if you create a Workspace
 for some project, you can associate only those Contacts that are in some
 way related to that project.</p>

<p>You can associate contacts with a workspace in one of two ways:</p>

<ul>

	<li class=kadov-p><p>Via the Workspaces dialog (best for associating
 multiple contacts all at once)</p></li>

	<li class=kadov-p><p>Via drag-and-drop (best for adding one or two
 new contacts to a Workspace)</p></li>
</ul>

<div class=proc>
<p class=procHead>To associate Contacts via the Workspaces dialog:</p>

<ol>

	<li class=kadov-p><p>Choose <strong>Workspaces | Add/Edit Workspaces.</strong></p></li>

	<li class=kadov-p><p>In the <strong>Workspaces</strong> dialog, select the Workspace
 in the list of Workspaces.</p>
	</li>

	<li class=kadov-p><p>Select the <strong>Contacts</strong> tab. The list on the left
 (<em>Available</em>) lists all Contacts. The list on the right lists all
 Contacts currently associated with the selected Workspace.</p>
	</li>

	<li class=kadov-p><p>In the <em>Available</em> list, select the Contact(s)
 you want to associate with the Workspace. You can begin typing a name
 in the box above the list to locate a Contact in the list.</p></li>

	<li class=kadov-p><p>With the desired Contact(s) selected in the <em>Available</em>
 list, click the <strong>Add</strong> button to add the selected Contact(s)
 to the selected Workspace.</p></li>

	<li class=kadov-p><p>Click the <strong>Close</strong> button when you
 have added all the Contacts you want for the Workspace.</p></li>
</ol>
</div>
<p> </p>
<div class=proc>
<p class=procHead>To associate Contacts via Drag-and-Drop:</p>

<ol>

	<li class=kadov-p><p>Locate the Contact you want to add to a different
 Workspace using any of the ways described in this topic.</p></li>

	<li class=kadov-p><p>Select the Contacts in the <strong>Items List</strong>.</p>
	</li>

	<li class=kadov-p><p>Drag it over the selector for the target Workspace
 and drop it there. (Workspace selectors appear beneath the main menu.)</p></li>
</ol>
</div>

<a name=sharing></a>

<h3 style="x-condition: PRO;">Sharing Contacts with Others</h3>

<p style="x-condition: PRO;">You can share any of your Contacts with other
 Omea Pro users via e-mail. A special data file is automatically attached
 to the e-mail message. The recipient can import the data from the attachment
 in to his or her copy of Omea Pro to create a new Contact record or records
 from the attached Contact data file.</p>

<h4 style="x-condition: PRO;">Sending a Contact</h4>

<div class=proc
	style="x-condition: PRO;">
<p class=procHead>To send a Contact to another Omea Pro user:</p>

<ol>

	<li class=kadov-p>Locate the Contact you want to send and select it
 in the <strong>Items List</strong>. You can optionally select multiple Contacts.</li>

	<li class=kadov-p>
	Right-click and choose <strong>Send Resources</strong> on the context
 menu. The <strong>Send Resources</strong> dialog for Contact appears.<br />
	<img src="../images/sshots/dialogs/pro/send_resource_contact.png"

	<p class=caption>The Send Resources dialog for Contact</p>
	</li>

	<li class=kadov-p>The dialog lists all the various types of contact
 information for the selected Contact. Check the box next to each type
 of contact information you want to send. Clear the checkbox for any you
 don't want to include.</li>

	<li class=kadov-p>Click the <strong>Create Email</strong> button. A
 new e-mail message is created with a file attachment named <em>resourcetransfer.xml</em></li>

	<li class=kadov-p>As you would for any e-mail message, address the
 message to the desired recipient(s), provide a Subject, optionally write
 text in the message body, and send the message.</li>
</ol>
</div>

<h4 style="x-condition: PRO;">Importing a Contact someone has sent you</h4>

<p style="x-condition: PRO;">If another Omea Pro user sends you a Contact
 by e-mail, when you view the message in the <strong>Item Viewer</strong>, you will see
 a bar like the following at the top of the pane:</p>

<p class=resLink
	style="x-condition: PRO;">Click to receive attached resources</p>

<p style="x-condition: PRO;">Click the link to receive the attached Contact
 and import it to your Omea contacts. The <strong>Receive Contact</strong> dialog opens. </p>
<p style="x-condition: PRO;"><img src="../images/sshots/dialogs/pro/receive_resources.png" alt="Receive Resources dialog" width="368" height="157"></p>
<p class="caption" style="x-condition: PRO;">Receive Resources dialog displaying e-mail address </p>
<p style="x-condition: PRO;">It displays
     the contact details contained in the attached data file. You can select
     which details to import. Click <strong>Receive</strong> to add a Contact to your Contacts list. Note that the received Contact does not go into
     any address book. If you want to add it to one of your address books,
     select the <em>All</em> view in the <strong>Views and Categories</strong> pane, use <strong>Quick
     Find</strong> to locate the received Contact, and then drag it from the <em>Items List</em> into an address
     book.</p>
