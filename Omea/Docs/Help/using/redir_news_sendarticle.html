   This is a hack for the fact that RoboHelp does not currently support conditional bookmarks.
	This file is used in the TOC instead of the anchor "sending", i.e. <a name="sending"></a>

	This topic is conditional to Pro only. So when user clicks the TOC link to this topic,
	there is an immediate redirect to the anchor in the topic.

	It's a hack until RH supports conditional bookmarks. But it works.
