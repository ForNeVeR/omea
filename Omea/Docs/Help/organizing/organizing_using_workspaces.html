<h1>Organizing Using Workspaces</h1>

<p>Workspaces enable you to work with a subset of all the resources on
 your computer in a context that’s meaningful to you. You can create Workspaces
 for different projects, activities, or even people. For each Workspace,
 you can define what resources are available to you while working in it.
 For example, if you have two projects you are working on, you can create
 a Workspace for each one. You can then define which resources you want
 to have available when working on each project: <span style="x-condition: PRO;">Windows
 and Outlook folders, </span>on-line resources such as feeds, newsgroups,
 and web pages, and Contacts.</p>

<p>Then, when you work on one of the projects, you have available all the
 resources you need for it, but no more. The &quot;noise&quot;... that
 is, the aggregate mass of information on your computer, is effectively
 filtered out. You don’t waste time wading through information that’s not
 relevant to what you’re working on. The aggregate mass of information
 is still there of course. It is represented by the default <em>All</em> Workspace, which is always present (and for some people it may be enough).
 If you need something that’s not in a custom Workspace, you can switch
 to <em>All</em> and browse or search for it. You can then make it part
 of any custom Workspace(s) you may have set up.</p>
<a name=workspaces></a>

<h2>How are Categories Related to Workspaces?</h2>

<p>You will most likely want to get started with Omea by creating Categories
 in the <em>All</em> Workspace. This is the default Workspace, always
 present, and it contains all of the resources you are managing with <span
 style="x-condition: READER;">Omea Reader</span><span style="x-condition: PRO;">Omea
 Pro</span>. Later on, you may decide to create additional Workspaces to
 contain subsets of your resources that you work with in a particular context.
 (For more information, see <a href="organizing_using_workspaces.html">Organizing
 Using Workspaces</a>).</p>

<p>The main things to remember about Categories and Workspaces are:</p>

<ul>

	<li class=omguy>Categories you create in the <em>All</em> Workspace
 can be optionally added to and accessed from any custom Workspaces you
 create.</li>

	<li class=omguy>Categories you create when working in a custom Workspace
 are accessible in that Workspace and <em>All</em>, but not in other custom
 Workspaces.</li>
</ul>

<p>For example, suppose you create a Workspace named &quot;Project ABC&quot;
 and another named &quot;Personal&quot;. While working in the <em>Project
 ABC</em> Workspace, you create a Category named &quot;Whitepaper Research&quot;
 In this case, your <em>Whitepaper Research</em> Category will show up
 when you are working in <em>Project ABC</em>, but not when you are in
 the <em>Personal</em> Workspace. It will appear in the <em>All</em> Workspace,
 however.</p>

<a name=new></a>

<h2>Creating a New Workspace</h2>

<div class=proc>
<p class=procHead>To create a new Workspace:</p>

<ol>

	<li class=kadov-p>Choose <strong>Workspaces | Add/Edit Workspaces</strong>
 on the Main menu. The Workspaces dialog appears.</li>

	<li class=kadov-p>Click the <strong>New</strong> button. Enter a name
 for the new Workspace and press OK.</li>

	<li class=kadov-p>
	Select the new Workspace in the list of Workspaces and browse through the <em>Resources in Workspace</em> tab. In each tab, select the resources
 you want to be available in this Workspace and click the <strong>Add</strong> (or for some resources, <strong>Add
 Subtree</strong>) button to add them to the new Workspace. (For more information
 see <em>Add vs. Add Subtree</em>) below. The added resources appear in &quot;<em>In Workspace</em>&quot; area.
 <div class=note>
 <div class="noteImg"
	style="/*begin!kadov{{*/ x-right: 944px; x-bottom: 3017px; /*}}end!kadov*/ ">
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
  </div>
	<p class=note>Only those resources that you have specified for indexing
 in your <a href="../reference/index.html">Options</a> settings will appear
 in the Available list.</p>
	</div>
	</li>
	<li class=kadov-p>Select the color of the Workspace in the <em>Color area</em> under the <em>Resources in Workspace</em> tabs. As you click  different places of the color selector, you can preview the resulting color in a small square at the left from the color selector. <br>
	  To select a different color than the one available of the color selector area, click <strong>Other</strong>&#8230;. In the <strong>Color</strong> window which opens, select the desired color in the <strong>Basic colors</strong> list or define a <em>Custom</em> color. After you have selected or defined the desired color, click <strong>OK</strong> to close the <strong>Color</strong> window and return to Workspace editing. </li>
    <li class=kadov-p>When you have specified all the resources you want
   to access and work with in the new Workspace, click <strong>Close</strong>.</li>
</ol>
</div>

<h3>&#8220;Add&#8221; and &#8220;Add Subtree&#8221;</h3>

<p>The <span style="x-condition: PRO;"><strong>Mail</strong>, </span><strong>News</strong>, <strong>Web</strong>, <strong>Feeds</strong>, <span
 style="x-condition: PRO;"><strong>Files</strong>, </span>and <strong>Category</strong> tabs of the Workspaces dialog provide two
 button controls for adding resources to a Workspace:</p>

<ul>

	<li class=kadov-p><strong style="font-weight: bold;">Add</strong> adds
 only top-level content to the Workspace</li>

	<li class=kadov-p><strong style="font-weight: bold;">Add Subtree</strong>
 adds top-level content, plus content from any sub levels that may exist
 now, or which may be added to the structure in the future.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Example</h4>

<p>Suppose you are adding Feeds to a Workspace. Let’s say you have a feed
 group folder <em>Software</em>, which contains a feed <em>Software News</em>,
 and a sub-folder <em>JetBrains</em> which contains feeds named <em>Omea
 News</em> and <em>IDEA News</em>.</p>

<p>If you select the <em>Software</em> folder and click <strong>Add</strong>, your Workspace
 will only contain the <em>Software News</em> feed because that item is
 in the top-level folder, and <strong>Add</strong> does not include any sub-folders.</p>

<p>If you want to add <em>all</em> the contents of the <em>Software</em> folder
 including the <em>JetBrains</em> sub-folder use <strong>Add Subtree</strong> to add the
 content to the Workspace.</p>

<a name=switching></a>

<h2>Switching between Workspaces</h2>

<p>There are 2 ways to switch between Workspaces:</p>

<ul>

	<li class=kadov-p>Main <strong>Workspaces</strong> menu</li>

	<li class=kadov-p>Workspace selectors in the main window</li>
    <li class=kadov-p>Keyboard shortcuts (<strong>Ctrl+Tab</strong> to move to next Workspace and <strong>Ctrl+Shift+Tab</strong> to move to previous Workspace) </li>
</ul>

<h3>Workspaces Menu</h3>

<p>The Workspaces menu enables you to navigate randomly or sequentially
 between Workspaces. Sequential navigation is provided with the <em>Next
 Workspace</em> and <em>Previous Workspace</em> and their respective keyboard
 shortcuts <strong>Ctrl + Tab</strong> and <strong>Ctrl + Shift + Tab</strong>.</p>

<!--kadov_tag{{<implicit_p>}}--><img src="../images/sshots/shared/workspace_menu.png"
									/
									style="width: 239px;
											height: 140px;
											vertical-align: 'Workspaces menu';"
									width=239
									height=140
									border=0>

<p class=caption>The Workspaces menu</p>

<p>The bottom section of the menu lists the currently defined Workspaces.
 You can randomly choose any Workspace and move directly into it.</p>

<h3>Workspace Selectors</h3>

<p>These appear in the Main window just below the Main menu, to the right
 of the bold-face <strong>Workspaces</strong> label. The current Workspace
 appears highlighted. Switch Workspaces by clicking on the one you want
 to switch into.</p>

<!--kadov_tag{{<implicit_p>}}--><img src="../images/sshots/shared/workspace_switch.png"
									alt="Workspace selectors"
									/
									style="width: 474px;
											height: 175px;
											border: 1px solid #999999;
											padding: 4px;"
									width=474
									height=175
									border=1>

<p class=caption>Switching Workspaces with selectors</p>

<p>If Workspace selectors are out of view due to lack of space to display
 them, a &quot;chevron&quot; button appears at the right edge of the Workspace
 selectors. When you click it, a menu list of the hidden Workspaces appears.
 You can navigate into any of these &quot;hidden&quot; Workspaces by clicking
 the Workspace name in the menu list.</p>

<!--kadov_tag{{<implicit_p>}}--><img src="../images/sshots/shared/workspace_more.png"
									alt="Selecting &quot;hidden&quot; Workspaces"
									/
									style="width: 639px; height: 154px;"
									width=639
									height=154
									border=0>

<p class=caption>Selecting Workspaces when there is insufficient room to
 show the selectors (in Omea Reader) </p>

<div class=tip>
<p class=tip>If you have multiple Workspaces, you can hide any one of the
 selectors from view using the <em>Hide</em> item on the context menu of
 the Workspace selector. You can use the &quot;chevron&quot; button (described
 above) to restore a hidden selector.</p>
</div>

<a name=resources></a>

<h2>Associating Resources with a Workspace</h2>

<p>All resources are always available in the default <em>All</em> workspace.
 If you have multiple Workspaces, you may encounter situations where...</p>

<ul>

	<li class=kadov-p>...you left some resources out of a Workspace when
 you defined it, or</li>

	<li class=kadov-p>...you have added some resources in another Workspace
 and you want to associate them with another Workspace (other than <em>All</em>).</li>

</ul>

<div class=proc>
<p class=procHead>To associate a resource with a Workspace:</p>

<ol>

	<li class=kadov-p>Locate the resource in a Workspace in which it now
 appears and select it.</li>

	<li class=kadov-p>Drag the resource and drop it on the Workspace selector.</li>
</ol>

The resource will now show up in the Workspace you selected.

<div class=tip>
<div class=tipImg
	style="/*begin!kadov{{*/ x-right: 747px; x-bottom: 776px; /*}}end!kadov*/ ">
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
      </div>
<p class=tip>Alternatively, or if the target Workspace selector is not
 currently in view, you can choose <strong>Add to Workspace</strong> on
 the main Actions menu or the resource’s context menu. The <em>Select Workspace</em>
 dialog appears listing all your current custom Workspaces. Select the
 Workspace you want the resource to be part of, and click OK.</p>
</div>
</div>

<a name=categories></a>

<h2>Associating Categories with Workspaces</h2>

<p>The main things to remember about Categories and Workspaces are:</p>

<ul>

	<li class=omguy>Categories you create in the <em>All</em> Workspace
 can be optionally added to and accessed from any custom Workspaces you
 create.</li>

	<li class=omguy>Categories you create when working in a custom Workspace
 are accessible in that Workspace and <em>All</em>, but not in other custom
 Workspaces.</li>
    <li class=omguy>When you add a category to a Workspace, all resources in that Category are visible in that Workspace. </li>
</ul>

<p>Suppose you have created some Category in some Workspace, and you later
   decide you want that Category available in another Workspace where it
   is currently not available. You can easily add it to the other Workspace.</p>
<div class=proc>
<p class=procHead>To add a Category to a different Workspace:</p>

<ol>

	<li class=kadov-p>Switch to the Workspace where the Category now appears
 if you are not already in it.</li>

	<li class=kadov-p>Show the <em>Views and Categories </em>pane if it
 is not currently visible. (Click the Views and Categories button in the
 Left Sidebar.) </li>

	<li class=kadov-p>In the Views and Categories pane, select the Category
 you want added to a different Workspace.</li>

	<li class=kadov-p>On the main Actions menu, or on the Category’s context
 menu, choose <strong>Add to Workspace</strong>. The <em>Select Workspace</em>
 dialog appears listing all your current custom Workspaces.</li>

	<li class=kadov-p>Select the Workspace you want the Category to be
 part of, and click OK.</li>
</ol>
</div>
<a name=navigating></a>
<h2>Navigating to Resources Associated with Workspace</h2>
<p>Besides the possibility to isolate yourself from a bunch of information you can now easily navigate to the unread resources in your Workspaces<em> by clicking the Unread Items counter</em> in the Workspaces bar. When you move the mouse pointer to the unread items in the Workspaces bar, the mouse pointer images changes and the number of unread items will also be displayed in a tooltip. </p>
<p style="x-condition: PRO;"><img src="../images/sshots/pro/workspaces_tooltip_link.png" alt="Workspaces bar" width="615" height="184"></p>
<p style="x-condition: READER;"><img src="../images/sshots/reader/workspaces_tooltip_link.png" alt="Workspaces bar" width="615" height="184"></p>

<a name=removing></a>

<h2>Removing a Workspace</h2>

<p>Your custom Workspaces need not be permanent fixtures. If things change
 and the Workspace no longer provides a relevant or useful context for
 you, you can delete the Workspace.</p>
<div class=note>
<div class="noteImg"
	style="/*begin!kadov{{*/ x-right: 944px; x-bottom: 3017px; /*}}end!kadov*/ ">
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
  </div>
  <p class=note>When you delete a Workspace, you delete only the Workspace definition. <strong>No resources are deleted</strong> from <span style="x-condition: READER;">Omea Reader</span><span style="x-condition: PRO;">Omea Pro</span>. All the resources that were available in the deleted Workspace will still be accessible in the <em>All</em> Workspace, and any other custom Workspace(s) that may be accessing them. If you create a new Workspace, you can associate any of the resources that were part of the deleted Workspace with the new Workspace.</p>
</div>
<div class=proc>
<p class=procHead>To delete a Workspace:</p>

<ol>

	<li class=kadov-p>Choose <strong>Workspaces | Add/Edit Workspaces</strong>
 on the Main menu. The Workspaces dialog appears.</li>

	<li class=kadov-p>In the Workspaces list, select the Workspace(s) you
 want to delete.</li>

	<li class=kadov-p>Click the <strong>Delete</strong> button to delete
 the selected Workspace definition(s).</li>

	<li class=kadov-p>Click the <strong>Close</strong> button to close
 the dialog.</li>
</ol>
</div>

<h2>Tips and Tricks</h2>
<a name=removingresources></a>
<h3>Removing Resources from Custom Workspaces</h3>
<p>You have probably come through the following situation. You have created a custom Workspace and added some resources to this new Workspace but these resources  also exist in the <em>All</em> Workspace. The important thing is when you delete these resources from this custom workspace, the resources will also be deleted from the <em>All</em> Workspace and will no longer be available for you.</p>
<p>To avoid such situation and not to loose some really important information, you need to configure the properties of the custom Workspace (remove the resources which you don't want to work with in this Workspace) but not to delete the items which this Workspace &#8220;shares&#8221; with the <em>All</em> Workspace. To do it, you need to repeat a usual procedure when you add resources to the Workspace but the difference is&#8230; you have to remove the resources which you no longer want to work with in the custom Workspace or Workspaces . From the <strong>Workspaces</strong> menu, select <strong>Add/Edit Workspace</strong>, select the desired Workspace in the list of Workspaces, click the appropriate resource tab, select a resource in the right part of the screen and click <strong>Remove</strong>). The resources in the <em>All</em> Workspace will remain untouched, but will no longer be available in the custom Workspace. </p>
<a name=workspacesandshortcuts></a>
<h3>Workspaces and Shortcuts</h3>
<p>You can now add shortcuts to custom and default <strong>Views</strong> and <strong>View folders</strong> (from the <strong>Views and Categories</strong> pane) which exist in different Workspaces. Such shortcuts will allow you to quickly jump to the desired View or Pane in a Workspace different from the one you work in at the moment.</p>
<p>To add such shortcut, select the desired <strong>View</strong> or <strong>View folder</strong> in the <strong>Views and Categorie</strong>s pane of some resource tab of a custom Workspace, then drag it and drop to the <strong>Shortcuts</strong> bar. As you drag the resource to the Shortcuts bar, the mouse pointer changes as in figure below. </p>
<p><img src="../images/sshots/shared/shortcuts_bar_add_shortcut.png" alt="Adding Shortcut" width="311" height="42"></p>
<p class="caption">Adding a shortcut </p>
<p>The  shortcut which you have added while working in a different workspace (different from <em>All</em>), will have the following name: name of the resource tab followed by the name of the Workspace, then a colon and a name of the View. </p>
<p><img src="../images/sshots/shared/shortcuts_bar.png" alt="Shortcuts bar" width="409" height="27"></p>
<p class="caption">Shortcuts bar (Shortcuts from different workspaces have been added) </p>
<p>You can later rename the shortcuts and change their order using <a href="using_shortcuts.html#organizesshot">Organize Shortcuts</a> dialog. </p>
<a name=otherviewwsp></a>
<h3>&#8220;Other&#8221; View in Workspaces</h3>
<p>You may come over the situation when some interesting resource appeared in a Custom or <em>All</em> Workspace you want to add this resource to a Workspace other than <em>All</em>. You can do it when</p>
<ul>
  <li>  you select several items in the <strong>Items List</strong> of any resource tab (News, Web, Feeds, etc.) </li>
  <li>or in the resource pane (<strong>Feeds, Newsgroups,  <span style="x-condition: PRO;">Outlook Folders, ICQ Correspondents,</span> Bookmarks <span style="x-condition: PRO;">, Indexed Folders</span></strong>), </li>
  </ul>
<p>then right-click and select <strong>Add to Workspace</strong> or when you open <a href="../reference/manage_workspaces.html#other">Workspaces dialog</a> (<strong>Workspaces&gt;Add/Edit Workspaces</strong>) and add some resources to <em>Other View </em>area of the resource tab in this dialog </p>
<p>or</p>
<p>drag the resources either from some resource pane or the <strong>Items List</strong> and drop them to the Custom workspace button. </p>
<p>All these actions will result in what you can see in the so called <strong>Other View</strong> of the <strong>Workspaces</strong> dialog and a special <em>Other View</em> of the <strong>Views and Categories</strong> pane or the resource pane . This View appears either in <strong>Views and Categories</strong> pane and in <em>Other</em> area of the Workspaces dialog when you select the Workspace to which you have added these resources. </p>
<p>To see the resources in the <em>Other View</em>, click the <em>Other View</em> icon (<img src="../images/iconsMarks/ico_other_view.png" width="16" height="16" class="linkIcon">). The resources appear in Omea's <strong>Items List</strong>. </p>
<h3>Reordering Workspaces</h3>
<p>To change the order of the Workspaces in the <strong>Workspaces</strong> bar, open the <a href="../reference/manage_workspaces.html"><strong>Workspaces</strong></a> dialog, select the desired Workspace the order and click either  <img src="../images/iconsMarks/ico_wsp_up.png" width="12" height="11" class="linkIcon"> or <img src="../images/iconsMarks/ico_wsp_down.png" width="12" height="11" class="linkIcon">  to move the Workspaces up or down (respectively) in the list of Workspaces in the <strong>Workspaces</strong> bar. As you do it, the order of the Workspaces in the <strong>Workspaces bar</strong> also changes. </p>
