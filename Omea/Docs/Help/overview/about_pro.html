<h1>Introducing Omea Pro</h1>

<p>Welcome to Omea Pro... a uniquely different and productive way to tame
 information overload and work with all that stuff on your computer! What
 exactly <em>is</em> Omea Pro? It's actually several things rolled into
 one.</p>

<p><strong style="font-weight: bold;">It's a communications center:</strong><br
 />
Omea Pro is a unique &quot;Personal Communications Environment&quot;. It
 does away with the need for separate programs to handle different kinds
 of communications such as e-mail, instant messages, newsgroups, and RSS
 and Atom feeds, enabling you to work with all these different types in
 one unified interface. But there's much more to Omea Pro than just acting
 as a central communications depot.</p>

<p><strong style="font-weight: bold;">It's an information organizer:</strong><br
 />
Omea Pro is also part information organizer... a &quot;Personal Information
 Environment&quot;, if you will. With Omea Pro you can organize the information
 resources stored on your computer in ways that are meaningful to <em>you</em>,
 rather than to your computer's operating system or some application program.
 You can organize information in-flows according to your daily activities,
 current projects, people you connect with, etc. You can create tasks from
 incoming items and attach to them all relevant information of any kind,
 stored anywhere on your computer or available on the Web.</p>

<p>If some information is relevant to more than one thing, you can link
 to it from multiple contexts and Omea Pro will find it when you work in
 any of them. Say you have e-mails and documents from your boss that relate
 to a project you are responsible for, and also to your supervision of
 employees. You can create separate &quot;Categories&quot; for your Project
 and your Employee Supervision activities, and also a custom &quot;View&quot;
 that shows all correspondence with your boss. You can create custom &quot;Workspaces&quot;
 that let you deal with any one of these as a separate context where you'll
 be able to quickly access the relevant resources. But there's more yet
 to Omea Pro.</p>

<p><strong style="font-weight: bold;">It's a search engine:</strong><br
 />
No matter how well you organize your information, chances are in a few
 weeks or months you won't remember exactly what it is or how to locate
 it in your organization scheme. That's why Omea Pro is also part search
 engine. Not for the Internet, but for your PC. Just as an Internet search
 engine does for content on the Web, so Omea Pro indexes and cross-links
 the content of your computer. That enables you to find everything on your
 machine that relates to your search query regardless of when you received
 it, where it's stored, or what kind of resource it is... a message of
 some kind, a Web page, a newsgroup article , a feed posting, or a file
 (stored locally or attached to a message). And searches are lightning
 fast... no more wasted time while Windows tediously searches through every
 file in every folder.</p>

<p><strong>It's a web research tool:</strong><br>
  Many activities today require people to collect, organize and share online information from many different resources &#8212; emails, feeds, news articles, files, websites&#8230; </p>
<p>Using Omea Pro's Clippings (excerpts of text for later reference), you can &#8220;cut&#8221; and save the pieces of information  easily  both from within  Omea Pro and such web browsers as   Internet Explorer<sup>&copy;</sup>, Firefox<sup>&copy;</sup>, and Mozilla<sup>&copy;</sup>. Additionally, you can create bookmarks of web pages both in Omea Pro and web browsers.</p>
<p>After your  collection of Clippings and web pages is ready or in the process of its creation, you can apply multiple Omea's organizational features to them &#8212; associate your Clippings and web bookmarks with one or several Categories, write notes on why you consider these items useful, and so on. And also share your Clippings with other Omea Pro users instantly. </p>
<p><strong style="font-weight: bold;">It's all this and more...</strong><br
 />
    So far we haven't touched on any of the many convenience and productivity
   features found in Omea Pro... such as free-form text annotations, custom
   cross-linking of resources, automatic, intelligent &quot;see also&quot; links to potentially relevant resources, shortcuts to resources you need
   most often, and more. Everything fits together to deliver a smart, easy
   to learn, easy to use solution for processing and working with electronic
   information.</p>
