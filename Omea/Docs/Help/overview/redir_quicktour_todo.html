<!-- 
   This is a hack for the fact that RoboHelp does not currently support conditional bookmarks.
	This file is used in the TOC instead of the anchor "todolist", i.e. <a name="totolist"></a>
	
	This topic is conditional to Pro only. So when user clicks the TOC link to this topic, 
	there is an immediate redirect to the anchor in the actual topic.
	
	It's a hack until RH supports conditional bookmarks. But it works.
