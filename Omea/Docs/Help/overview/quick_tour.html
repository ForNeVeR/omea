<h1>Quick Tour</h1>

<p>This topic introduces the <span style="x-condition: READER;">Omea Reader</span><span 
 style="x-condition: PRO;">Omea Pro</span> main window and its parts.</p>

<a name=mainwin></a>
<h2>The Main Window</h2>

<a name=sshot></a>

<div style="x-condition: READER;">

<p class=caption>The Omea Pro main window (Feeds tab is selected) </p>
</div>

<a name=menubar></a>

<h3>Main Menu</h3>

<p>The Main menu provides access to all the major features of <span style="x-condition: READER;">Omea 
 Reader</span><span style="x-condition: PRO;">Omea Pro</span>. Menu commands 
 that are not relevant to your current context are disabled so you cannot 
 invoke them. Disabled commands appear &quot;grayed&quot; in all menus.</p>
<a name=workspaces></a>

<h3>Workspace Controls</h3>

<p>This area at the top of the Main window enables you to see your currently-defined 
 Workspaces, switch between Workspaces, create a new Workspace, and see 
 the number of unread items in each Workspace. The <em>All</em> Workspace 
 is always present and enables access to all your resources. It is the 
 only Workspace unless you create more Workspaces. For more information 
 on Workspaces, see <a href="../organizing/organizing_using_workspaces.html">Organizing 
 Using Workspaces</a>.</p>
<a name=shortcuts></a>

<h3>Shortcuts Bar</h3>
<p>Shortcuts allow you to conveniently access items that may be stored somewhere very deep in Omea. 


 You can shortcut any resource available in Omea  so that your resources are just one click away.</p>
<p style="x-condition: PRO;">In Omea Pro, a shortcut to the Outlook Inbox 
 is automatically placed to the <span style="font-style: italic;">Shortcuts 
 Bar</span>. But of course you can add links to any other resources you 
 need to access most frequently. You might create a shortcut to your company’s 
 intranet, for example. </p>

<p>For more information, see <a href="../organizing/using_shortcuts.html">Organizing 
 Using Shortcuts.</a></p>
<a name=search></a>

<h3>Basic Search</h3>
<p>This is where you access the internal search engine to find resources 
 on your computer. You can run <a href="../search/basic_search.html">Basic 
 Search</a> right there. A link to <a href="../search/adv_search.html">Advanced 
 Search</a> is handy just to the right.</p>



<a name=tabs></a>

<h3>Resource Tabs</h3>

<p>There is a Resource tab for each of the <a href="key_concepts.html#resources">resource 
 types</a> you can work with in <span style="x-condition: READER;">Omea 
 Reader</span><span style="x-condition: PRO;">Omea Pro</span>. Selecting 
 a tab enables you to browse a list of resources (Items List) of the relevant 
 type and to read individual items. For information about the different 
 parts inside Resource tabs, see <a href="#insidetabs">Inside Resource 
 Tabs</a> later in this topic.</p>



<p><a name=prevnext></a>
    
</p>
<h3>Back-Forward Buttons</h3>

<p><span style="x-condition: READER;">Omea Reader</span><span style="x-condition: PRO;">Omea 
 Pro</span> maintains a history of the resources you access during each 
 session. These buttons provide sequential access to this history. <em>Back</em> 
 takes you to the previous resource in the history, <em>Forward</em> takes 
 you to the next resource. If there is no previous or next resource in 
 the history, the buttons are disabled accordingly.</p>
<div style="x-condition: PRO;">
<a name=todolist></a>
<h3>To Do List</h3>

<p>The To Do list appears to the far right of the Main window. It lists 
 your unfinished tasks (if any), and includes links to any resources linked 
 to those tasks. You can also create new tasks by typing a name in the 
 To Do list, or dragging and dropping any resource into the To Do list. 
 The context menu of Tasks appearing in the To Do list provides access 
 to the Task dialog where you can edit all properties of the selected task 
 including Status and Reminder.</p>
</div>

<a name=statusbar></a>

<h3>Status Bar</h3>

<p>Appears along the bottom edge of the Main window. It shows information 
 about the state of <span style="x-condition: READER;">Omea Reader</span><span 
 style="x-condition: PRO;">Omea Pro</span> and/or its processes such as 
 indexing.</p>

<a name=insidetabs></a>

<h2>Inside Resource Tabs</h2>

<p>When you select one of the Resource Tabs, you can navigate, browse, 
 read, and process resources of the selected type (and possibly other types 
 as well, such as attachments). The component parts grouped under a resource 
 tab are basically the same for all resource types. The difference is what 
 you can view and access.</p>

<p>Refer to the <a href="#sshot">picture</a> at the top of this file as 
 we work left-to-right and top-to-bottom through the parts of a Resource 
 Tab.</p>

<a name=navpanel></a>

<h3>Left Sidebar</h3>

<p>The Left Sidebar panel appears down the left side of the main window. 
 It is comprised of the following:</p>

<ul>
	
	<li class=kadov-p><strong style="font-weight: bold;">Panel splitter/closer:</strong> 
 appears along the right-hand edge of the pane. Used to resize the panel 
 horizontally, or hide it altogether.</li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p><strong style="font-weight: bold;">Panes:</strong> 
 Panes provide various ways to navigate to different kinds of resources. 
 Individual panes can be minimized or maximized within the Navigation panel 
 using the icons that appear in the pane title bar.</li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p><strong style="font-weight: bold;">Pane Toggle Buttons:</strong> 
 Aligned along the left-hand edge of the panel. They show and hide the 
 available Navigation panel panes. Along with the panes they affect, the 
 buttons vary according to the selected Resource Tab.</li>
</ul>

<a name=viewscats></a>

<h4>Panes: Views and Categories pane</h4>

<p>The <strong>Views and Categories</strong> pane is always present by default unless you 
 explicitly close it. Other panes can appear beneath this pane. This pane 
 provides access to <a href="../organizing/organizing_using_categories.html">Categories</a> 
 and <a href="../organizing/organizing_using_views.html">Views</a>, both 
 yours and the defaults. It also displays search results after searches 
 are run.</p>

<a name=dependents></a>

<h4>Panes: Resource-dependent panes</h4>

<p>The available panes vary according to <em>which Resource is currently selected</em>. 
 For example, the <strong>Feeds</strong> pane is only available in the Feeds tab.</p>

<div style="x-condition: PRO;">
<p>Clicking on an item in a resource-dependent pane filters the list of 
 resources to those directly applicable to the selection. For example, 
 if you click on a <strong>Feed</strong> in the <strong>Feeds</strong> pane, the <strong>Items List</strong> shows posts for 
 that feed. Or if you click on a <strong>Correspondent</strong> in the <strong>Correspondents</strong> pane 
 while working in the <strong>Mail</strong> tab, the <strong>Items List</strong> will show only messages 
 sent by or to that person.</p>
</div>

<div style="x-condition: READER;">
<p>Clicking on an item in a resource-dependent pane filters the list of 
 resources to those directly applicable to the selection. For example, 
 if you click on a <strong>Feed</strong> in the <strong>Feeds</strong> pane, the <strong>Items List</strong> shows posts for 
 that feed. Or if you click on a <strong>Correspondent</strong> in the <strong>Correspondents</strong> pane 
 while working in the <strong>News</strong> tab, the <strong>Items List</strong> will show only news articles 
 and replies posted by that person.</p>
</div>

<a name=resourceitemlist></a>

<h3>Items List</h3>

<p>This list shows all the resources in the currently selected View (either 
 in the <strong>Views and Categories</strong> pane, or a resource-dependent pane). For example, 
 if you are in the <strong>News</strong> tab, and the <em>Unread</em> view is selected in 
 <strong>Views and Categories</strong>, the list contains unread newsgroup articles. Or 
 if you select a newsgroup in the resource-dependent <strong>Newsgroups</strong> pane, the 
 list contains all articles in the selected newsgroup.</p>

<h4>List columns</h4>

<p>The <strong>Items List</strong>  is divided into columns, each of which displays 
 some relevant information such as <em>Date</em> or <em>Subject</em> or others. You can configure the 
 display of columns by right-clicking on any column header and choosing 
 <strong>Configure Columns</strong>. See <a href="../reference/columns_dialog.html">Configure Columns dialog</a>.</p>

<h4>Items List toolbar</h4>

<p>The toolbar provides quick access to a number of features or functions 
 available for the current resource type &#8212; printing or <a href="../search/quick_find.html">Quick 
 Find</a>, for example. Some of the available functions may be specific 
 to the particular resource type you are working with. For example, in 
 the Feeds tab, this toolbar has a button <em>Newspaper View</em> <img 
 src="../images/iconsMarks/ico_newspaper_view.gif"
	class=linkIcon
	/
	style="width: 16px;
			height: 16px;
			border-style: none;
			border-style: none;"
	width=16
	height=16
	border=0> which is applicable only to RSS/Atom feeds.</p>

<a name=itemviewer></a>

<h3>Item Viewer</h3>

<p>The Item Viewer enables you to read the item currently selected in the 
  <strong>Items List</strong>. </p>
<div class="note">
  <div class="noteImg"
	style="/*begin!kadov{{*/ x-right: 944px; x-bottom: 3017px; /*}}end!kadov*/ ">
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
  </div>
  <p class="note">If the item selected is not of a type viewable in <span style="x-condition: READER;">Omea Reader</span><span style="x-condition: PRO;">Omea Pro</span>, the view displays a message to that effect. If the item is a type for which an application is registered on your system, a button appears with which you can open the item in the associated application program.</p>
</div>

  <a name=linksbar></a>

<h4>Viewer Links bar</h4>

<p>This bar appears at the top of the <strong>Item Viewer</strong>. It displays links to 
 related information. For example, if you are reading a newsgroup article, 
 the bar has links to the contact record for the author, to any replies, 
 and to the newsgroup itself. For more information, refer to <a href="../organizing/organizing_using_links.html">Organizing Using Links</a>.</p>

<a name=linksactions></a>

<h4>Links &amp; Actions panel</h4>

<p>Sometimes there may not be room to display all the links that might 
 be relevant to the item you are reading in the <strong>Item Viewer</strong>. You can find 
 all links in the <strong>Links and Actions</strong> panel which appears to the right of 
 the <strong>Item Viewer</strong>.  You can toggle the panel with 
 the <strong>Show-Hide</strong> button (<img src="../images/iconsMarks/ico_hide.png" width="16" height="16" class="linkIcon">) on the Viewer <strong>Links Bar</strong>.</p>

<p>This panel also has links to actions you can take relative to the currently 
 displayed item. For example, you might click <em>Assign Categories</em> 
 to file the item in some Category(ies). The actions available depend on 
 the type of resource you are working with at the moment.</p>
