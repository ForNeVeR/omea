<h1>Key Concepts of Omea Reader</h1>

<p>A succinct conceptual summary of Omea Reader might be:</p>

<p class=indent>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>&quot;Track, organize, find,
 and access online information resources on your PC.&quot;</em></p>
</div>

<p>Let's look briefly at these main concepts.</p>

<a name=resources></a>

<h2>What are &quot;Resources&quot;?</h2>

<p>Basically, the term <em>resources</em> means any kind of <span style="x-condition: READER;">internet</span>
 content stored on your computer: <span style="x-condition: PRO;">files,
 messages,</span> newsgroup articles, RSS or ATOM feed posts, <span style="x-condition: READER;">and</span>
 <span style="x-condition: PRO;">even</span> downloaded web pages. <span
 style="x-condition: READER;">Omea Reader</span><span style="x-condition: PRO;">Omea
 Pro</span> enables you to work with the following types of resources:</p>

<ul>

	<li class=kadov-p
		style="x-condition: PRO;">E-mail messages (Mail tab)</li>

	<li class=kadov-p
		style="x-condition: PRO;"><a href="../using/com_im.html">Instant Messages (IM tab)</a></li>

<h2>Tracking Resources</h2>

<p><span style="x-condition: READER;">Omea Reader</span><span style="x-condition: PRO;">Omea
 Pro</span> tracks your resources using special <em>indexing</em> technology.
 The index information is stored in a highly efficient database that both
 tracks information in real time, and facilitates searching. The indexing
 process in <span style="x-condition: READER;">Omea Reader</span><span
 style="x-condition: PRO;">Omea Pro</span> is rather like the engine in
 your car: you don’t need to understand the inner workings in order to
 drive it, and you don't need to deal with it all the time.</p>

<div style="x-condition: PRO;">
<p>Indexing is mostly automatic. It happens behind the scenes as you process
 various kinds of resources using Omea Pro. The only time most people will
 need to think about indexing is the first time they start Omea Pro. Then,
 a special &quot;Setup Wizard&quot; appears that guides you through a process
 that tells Omea Pro what you want it to track in terms of file system
 folders, e-mail program folders, and Web bookmarks. As you become more
 familiar with Omea Pro, you may want to make additions or adjustments
 to the indexing configuration. You can do this any time using the <a href="../reference/options_dialog.html">Options
 dialog</a>.</p>

<p>Incoming resources are automatically tracked as they arrive on your
 PC, provided they land in one of the areas you've told Omea to track (you
 can specifically exclude some places, such as a <em>temp</em> folder or
 Outbox). Once tracked, resources can be found in searches. However, you
 will probably want to use Omea to help you organize them as they come
 in.</p>
</div>

<div style="x-condition: READER;">
<p>Indexing is mostly automatic. It happens behind the scenes as you process
 various kinds of resources using Omea Reader. The only time most people
 will need to think about indexing is the first time they start Omea Reader.
 Then, it's a good idea to check the <a href="../reference/options_dialog.html">Options
 dialog</a> and set the Internet options for <a href="../reference/favorites.html">Favorites</a>,
 and <a href="../reference/web_pages.html">Web Pages</a> (and <a href="../reference/mozilla_bookmarks.html">Mozilla
 Bookmarks</a> if you use a Mozilla browser). As you become more familiar
 with Omea Reader, you may want to make additions or adjustments to the
 indexing configuration. You can do this any time using the Options dialog.</p>

<p>Downloaded resources are automatically tracked as they arrive on your
 computer. Once tracked, resources can be found in searches. However, you
 will probably want to use Omea Reader to help you organize information
 as well.</p>

<h2>Organizing Resources</h2>

<p><span style="x-condition: READER;">Omea Reader</span><span style="x-condition: PRO;">Omea
 Pro</span> provides features for organizing your resources in a variety
 of ways that you can use separately or in combination. The emphasis is
 on organization that is meaningful to <em>you</em>, rather than to the
 computer operating system or some application program.</p>

<ul>

	<li class=kadov-p><strong style="font-weight: bold;">Categories:</strong>
 User-defined tags or labels that can be used to categorize resources in
 some way that’s meaningful for you. You can create your own highly flexible,
 cross-referenced filing system using Categories. See <a href="../organizing/organizing_using_categories.html">Organizing
 using Categories</a> for details.</li>

	<li class=kadov-p><strong style="font-weight: bold;">Views:</strong>
 Lists of resources matching some conditions which were specified by the user, or automatically selected and updated by <span style="x-condition: READER;">Omea
 Reader</span><span style="x-condition: PRO;">Omea Pro</span> or by you. For example, a view named <em>Today</em> would include
 only resources received or processed on the current date. See <a href="../organizing/organizing_using_views.html">Organizing
 using Views</a> for details.</li>

	<li class=kadov-p><strong style="font-weight: bold;">Links:</strong>
 Relationships between resources. Some are created automatically by
 <span style="x-condition: READER;">Omea Reader</span><span style="x-condition: PRO;">Omea
 Pro</span>; you can define others between resources to create associations
 that are meaningful and useful to you. See <a href="../organizing/organizing_using_links.html">Organizing
 using Links</a> for details.</li>

	<li class=kadov-p><strong style="font-weight: bold;">Workspaces:</strong>
 A named collection of resources that pertain to some organizational context
 that you decide on, such as a project, an activity, or people. In essence,
 a Workspace is like a filter that enables you to work with some subset
 of all possible resources in a context that means something to you. See
 <a href="../organizing/organizing_using_workspaces.html">Organizing using
 Workspaces</a> for details.</li>

	<li class=kadov-p
		style="x-condition: PRO;"><strong style="font-weight: bold;">Tasks:</strong>
 A record, that you create, of something you need to do at some future
 time. The unique thing about Tasks in Omea Pro is that they can contain
 links to all the resources of any type that you need to access in order
 to do them. You can create a Task directly from any resource. See <a href="../organizing/organizing_using_tasks.html">Organizing
 using Tasks</a> for details.</li>
    <li class=kadov-p><strong>Rules</strong>: Means that will help you to automate your incoming resources. Rules in Omea are much like those in Outlook but in Omea you can benefit from much greater variety of rule settings which you can easily customize. See <a href="../organizing/using_rules.html">Organizing using Rules</a>, <a href="../organizing/using_formatting_rules.html">Using formatting rules</a>, <a href="../organizing/notify_me.html">Setting notifications</a> and <a href="../reference/apply_rules_dialog.htm">Reapplying rules</a> for details. </li>
    <li class=kadov-p><strong>Annotations:</strong> A note which you can add to almost any resource in Omea. See <a href="../organizing/using_annotations.html">Using Annotations</a>. </li>
    <li class=kadov-p><strong>Shortcuts:</strong> Means which provide you one click access to the resources which may be stored very deep in Omea. See <a href="../organizing/using_shortcuts.html">Organizing using shortcuts</a> for details. </li>
    <li class=kadov-p><strong>Flags:</strong> Means for attracting attention to items which require some follow up. See <a href="../organizing/using_flags.htm">Organizing using Flags</a> for details. </li>
  </ul>

<a name=search></a>

<h2>Finding Resources</h2>

<p>Even if you've gone to great lengths to organize your resources, it
 can still be difficult to quickly lay your hands on exactly what you want,
 especially after some time has passed.</p>

<p>That’s where <span style="x-condition: READER;">Omea Reader</span><span
 style="x-condition: PRO;">Omea Pro</span> steps in with it’s robust Search
 capability. Essentially a &quot;search engine for your PC&quot;, <span
 style="x-condition: READER;">Omea Reader</span><span style="x-condition: PRO;">Omea
 Pro</span> can quickly locate the indexed resources on your computer just
 as internet search engines can quickly locate indexed content on the web.</p>

<div style="x-condition: PRO;">
<p>Unlike the Windows Explorer search, Omea Pro can find more than one
 kind of resource that relates to your query: files, messages, newsgroup
 articles, etc. Simple keyword searching is always at hand in the Search
 box in the main window. You can narrow down searches, limiting them to
 certain resource types and/or conditions using <a href="../search/adv_search.html">Advanced
 search</a>.</p>
</div>
<div style="x-condition: READER;">
<p>Omea Reader searches can find more than one kind of resource that relates
 to your query: both newsgroup articles and web pages, for example. <a
 href="../search/basic_search.html">Simple keyword searching</a> is always
 at hand in the Search box in the main window. You can narrow down searches,
 limiting them to certain resource types and/or conditions using <a href="../search/adv_search.html">Advanced
 search</a>. When focused on the list of a particular type of resource...
 articles in a newsgroup, for example... you can quickly search the listing
 with <a href="../search/quick_find.html">Quick Find</a> </p>
<div class="note">


<div class="noteImg"
	style="/*begin!kadov{{*/ x-right: 944px; x-bottom: 3017px; /*}}end!kadov*/ ">
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
  </div>
  <p class="note">The keywords, conditions, and results of any search are automatically saved to a special View called <em>Search Results</em>. With the context menu of this View, you can convert it a custom View. This in effect &quot;saves&quot; the search so you can run it again with a single click in the Views and Categories pane.</p>
</div>
<p>For more information see <a href="../search/index.html">Searching Your
 Computer's Resources</a>.</p>
