<h1>Extending Omea with New Resource Types</h1>
<h2>Introducing Omea</h2>
<p>JetBrains Omea, a new family of products from JetBrains, is an <i>Integrated 
Information Environment</i>. Omea helps you manage your entire information 
lifecycle:</p>
<ul>
	<li><b>Stay up to date</b>. Get notified when new e-mails arrive, feeds and 
	bookmarks are updated, and new posts appear in newsgroups. See the important 
	items first, and deal with the rest later.</li>
	<li><b>Process incoming information</b>. Reply to messages, delegate tasks 
	to other people, mark items to be processed later - all without leaving Omea.</li>
	<li><b>Find information any time</b>. Find the things you need, no matter 
	where they are stored - in e-mails, local files or on the Web. Browse links 
	between related items.</li>
	<li><b>Stay synchronized</b>. E-mails, contacts and tasks in Omea are kept 
	synchronized with Microsoft Outlook.</li>
</ul>
<p>Omea supports a large 
array of information kinds (e-mails, local files, weblog posts, contacts, tasks 
and so on) out of the box. However, no company could hope to cover all existing 
kinds of digital information in its product - there are always more or less 
exotic kinds of information (for example, bug tracker requests) that would be 
convenient to work with inside Omea, but are not supported by the JetBrains 
developers. Because of that, Omea has been designed to be completely extensible, 
based on the plugin model. In fact, almost all of the standard resource types 
supported by Omea are implemented as plugins, and the majority of services used 
by our plugins are also available to third-party developers through our Open 
API.</p>
<p>The main advantage of developing Omea plugins is that, by spending a small 
effort to describe your resource type to Omea, you automatically get its entire 
range of information organization and search facilities for free. The user will 
be able to categorize resources of your type, add them to workspaces, build 
views which return them, link them to other resources and so on. It works the 
other way, too - if you (or we at JetBrains) develop a new tool for organizing 
resources, it will automatically apply to all standard resource types and all 
resource types provided by third-party plugins.</p>
<p>Another advantage is that Omea Reader, the version of Omea currently 
available as a free download, does not carry any restrictions on loading 
third-party plugins. Omea Reader has the full range of search and organization 
features and the full set of Open API interfaces.</p>
<p>Omea is a .NET application, and its plugins are regular .NET assemblies. 
Plugins can be developed in any .NET programming language. While this article 
discusses a sample developed in C#, we plan to provide sample plugins created 
with Visual Basic .NET, Delphi 8 and possibly other .NET development 
environments.</p>
<p>This article will describe the general features and possibilities provided by 
the Omea Open API, and then will discuss an implementation of a sample plugin 
that will help you manage your book collection. It will take you just an hour or 
two to follow the plugin development tutorial , and as a result, you will 
understand how to implement all the basic functions of a plugin, and will be 
able to start developing your own plugins. </p>
<h2>Plugin Possibilities and Responsibilities</h2>
<p><a href="OmeaPluginContextMenu.png">
<img border="0" src="OmeaPluginContextMenu_small.png" align="right" xthumbnail-orig-image="OmeaPluginContextMenu.png" hspace="5" alt="Context menu actions provided by plugins (click to enlarge)"></a></p>
<p>There are two main kinds of plugins that can be developed for Omea. The 
first, simpler kind of plugins, does not add any new resource types to Omea, but 
rather extends the functionality of the existing ones. The most common way for 
doing that is registering new <i>actions</i> - commands available in the menus, 
toolbars and through keyboard shortcuts - which work on resources of the 
standard types. </p>
<p>The screenshot on the right shows a screenshot of an email with a selected 
text fragment. You can see that the actions shown in the menu have been provided 
by multiple plugins. The actions highlighted in yellow have been provided by the 
Outlook plugin, the &quot;New Task...&quot; action - by the Tasks plugin, and the last 
item, &quot;Look Up in Dictionary&quot;, has been provided by the Dictionary plugin which 
is a sample supplied with the Omea Open API documentation. The remaining menu 
items belong to the Omea core.</p>
<p>As the Dictionary plugin demonstrates, you can implement small and useful 
pieces of functionality with very little effort, and you don't need to learn the 
entire Omea Open API in order to do that. In fact, if you only understand how to 
register actions in the Omea UI and how to work with resources, you'll be able 
to implement a major portion of the features which have been suggested as plugin 
ideas by Omea users.</p>
<p>The second kind of plugins, which is the main focus of this 
article, extends Omea with entirely new resource types. Plugins of that kind 
usually add a new resource type tab to the Omea window, with new panels in the 
sidebars. Of course, plugins of the second kind can also register actions which 
are required to work with the resources of the new type.</p>
<p></p>
<p>A plugin which adds a new resource type interacts very closely with Omea 
core. Many of the core features only work 
on the resources provided by the plugin if the plugin took steps to support 
them. Other features do not require plugin interaction, but can be extended by 
plugins.<a href="OmeaPluginLayout.png"><img border="0" src="OmeaPluginLayout_small.png" xthumbnail-orig-image="OmeaPluginLayout.png" align="right"></a></p>
<p>In general, Omea strives to reduce the amount of work that must be done by a 
plugin developer by providing a standard UI framework which the plugin only 
fills with data. There are some parts of the user interface, like the controls 
for viewing and editing resources, that must be implemented by a plugin, but as 
the picture on the right shows, the amount of such UI is relatively small. The 
parts highlighted in yellow are the interface controls implemented by plugins 
(the Outlook plugin and the Tasks plugin). The cyan parts are controls 
implemented in Omea core which have been registered or filled with data by 
plugins.</p>
<p>Let us now go through the main features of Omea and discuss how they interact 
with plugins and how they can be extended.</p>
<p><b>Getting Resources into Omea</b>. If the resources are created by the user, 
the plugin needs to provide the interface for creating and editing them. The 
standard resource editing window in Omea consists of a frame provided by the 
core (with the OK and Cancel buttons and the validation label) and an editing 
pane - a custom control implemented by the plugin.</p>
<p>If the resources get into the system automatically (imported from an external 
application or downloaded from the network), Omea provides a powerful set of 
asynchronous processing facilities that helps you write the downloading or 
import code.</p>
<p><b>Working with Resources.</b> The minimum requirements for adding a resource 
type to Omea are:</p>
<ul>
	<li>There must be a view or a set of views which the user can select to see 
	a list of resources of the type. This can be achieved by registering a 
	sidebar pane to display the structure inherent to the resource type - for 
	example, the Outlook plugin registers a pane which displays the Outlook 
	folders tree. On the other hand, if the resources of the type have no 
	inherent structure, it may be sufficient to register some views which are 
	displayed in the standard &quot;Views and Categories&quot; pane. The Tasks plugin is 
	an example of a plugin of that kind - it does not register any sidebar panes 
	but it registers several new views (&quot;All Tasks&quot;, &quot;Not Started&quot; and so on).</li>
	<li>When the user selects a resource in the list, there must be a way to 
	show the contents of the resource. If the contents can be represented as 
	HTML, Omea provides a simple way to use the embedded Web browser directly 
	for displaying the resource contents (IM conversations are displayed in that 
	way) or to decorate it with additional controls (for example, the subject 
	and date of an e-mail). If the HTML representation is not appropriate, 
	custom controls of any complexity can be used (for example, contacts and 
	tasks are displayed in custom controls).</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Displaying Resource Lists</b>. Plugins can display resource lists in 
regular (linear) or threaded mode. A plugin also has several possibilities to 
customize how resources of its type are displayed in a list. It can specify the 
columns that need to be shown by default, and their default width. It can 
customize the way property values are converted to text (for example, task 
statuses are internally stored as numbers but displayed as strings) and the way 
resources are compared (for example, the &quot;Re:&quot; prefix is ignored when the 
resource list is sorted by subject). If that is not sufficient, a plugin can 
register a handler to perform custom drawing and event handling for a column. An 
example of a custom-drawn column is the &quot;Annotation&quot; column.</p>
<p>Plugins also provide the icons used to display the resources in resource 
lists and other places in the program. The icon used for a resource can depend 
on its state. There is a very easy to use system for specifying the property 
values and icons associated with them in an XML file. If the possibilities of 
that system are not sufficient, custom code can be written to return resource 
icons.</p>
<p><b>Searching Resources</b>. To make the resources of its type searchable, a 
plugin needs to be able to provide the contents of its resources as a series of 
plain-text fragments. Fragments can be grouped in several sections (for example, 
subject, body and annotation), and the user can restrict searching to a 
particular section. Text indexing in Omea is asynchronous - the plugin queues 
its resource to be indexed, and then some time later a callback is called to 
retrieve the resource text. The same callback is used to retrieve text fragments 
when contexts for search results are displayed.</p>
<p>Another responsibility of a plugin is highlighting the found words in the 
resource text. That functionality is implemented by the embedded Web browser, so 
there is no extra work required if it is used to display the resource contents.</p>
<p><a href="OmeaPluginWorkspaces.png">
<img border="0" src="OmeaPluginWorkspaces_small.png" xthumbnail-orig-image="OmeaPluginWorkspaces.png" align="right"></a></p>
<p><b>Workspaces.</b> Resources of any type not marked as internal can be added 
to a workspace, but plugin support may be needed to make this actually useful. 
For example, when an Outlook folder is added to the workspace, the e-mails in 
that folder must also become visible in the workspace, along with the 
attachments of those e-mails. This is handled by registering the resource type 
as workspace-aware and specifying the link types which connect the resource to 
other resources which it &quot;pulls&quot; with itself when it is added to the workspace.
</p>
<p>Plugins also have a limited possibility to customize the user interface used 
to select which resources of a particular type should be shown in a workspace.</p>
<p><b>Categories, Flags and Annotations.</b> These organization tools can be 
used on resources of any type which has not been marked as internal. Plugins can 
perform various operations with categories and automatically assign categories 
to resources. Plugins can also register additional flags and specify icons for 
them.</p>
<p><a href="OmeaPluginConditions.png">
<img border="0" src="OmeaPluginConditions_small.png" xthumbnail-orig-image="OmeaPluginConditions.png" align="right"></a></p>
<p><b>Views</b>. A plugin can register <i>conditions</i> which can be used to 
construct views and build advanced search queries. In most cases, conditions do 
not require custom programming. For example, the &quot;Task is not completed&quot; 
condition is registered simply as &quot;Value of the Status property for resources of 
type Task is less than 2&quot;. For conditions which cannot be expressed as simple 
operations on resources and their links (for example, the &quot;Sent only to me&quot; 
condition), it is possible to write a custom class which will be called to check 
which resources match the condition and whether a given resource is a match.</p>
<p>Plugins can also register views built of conditions - either standard ones or 
those provided by plugins.</p>
<p><b>Rules.</b> Rules are never invoked automatically by the Omea core. If it 
makes sense to process resources of a plugin by rules, the plugin needs to 
invoke the rule processor explicitly at the appropriate time. Plugins can also 
implement custom rule actions which accept a resource and a set of action 
parameters (for example, the folder where a received e-mail should be moved). 
The UI for editing the action parameters is provided by the core.</p>
<p><b>Clippings.</b> In order to support clippings, the plugin needs to be able 
to return the current selection as a plain-text, RTF or HTML string. If the 
selection is not empty, it can be turned into a clipping. The standard embedded 
Web browser supports the interface for returning the selected text, so if the 
plugin uses it to display resources, there is no extra work required to support 
clippings.</p>
<p><b>Sending Resources</b>. If a plugin needs a simple form of sending its 
resources as regular text emails (for example, &quot;Send by Email&quot; for bookmarks), 
it can invoke the standard service for creating e-mails. In Omea Reader, the 
e-mail service is implemented through the Simple MAPI interface, and in Omea Pro 
it uses the Outlook integration. If sending resources as text is not sufficient 
(for example, for contacts and tasks), the plugin can implement an interface for 
serializing its resources to an XML representation and restoring from that 
representation. Then it becomes possible to send those resources by email 
through the &quot;Send Resources&quot; feature.</p>
<h2>Creating and Registering a Plugin</h2>
<p>This article will discuss the main structure and responsibilities of a plugin 
which registers a new resource type. The example plugin discussed in the article 
is &quot;Librarian&quot; - a plugin which allows you to manage your book collection. It 
demonstrates a wide array of Omea interfaces that you will need to deal with 
when developing plugins, and at the same time does not involve any extra 
complexity related to integrating with external applications, protocols or data 
formats. The example implements only the bare minimum functionality, but you 
will be easily able to extend it if desired.</p>
<p>To create a new plugin in Visual Studio .NET, simply create a new project of 
type &quot;Class Library&quot; and add a reference to the OpenAPI.dll assembly from the 
Omea distribution. That assembly contains a set of classes and interfaces in the 
JetBrains.Omea.OpenAPI namespace which constitute the API available to the 
plugin developers. The documentation for the Open API is not included in the 
base Omea distribution and can be downloaded separately from 
<a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/omea/documentation.html">our Web site</a>.</p>
<p>In order for Omea to be able to load the plugin, it should implement the <code> IPlugin</code> 
interface. The interface consists of three methods - <code> Register</code>(), <code> Startup</code>() 
and <code> Shutdown</code>(). The plugin startup sequence is fully described in 
the OpenAPI documentation; here we will simply note that <code> Register()</code> 
is the first method called after a plugin has been loaded, and we will perform 
all the initialization in that method.</p>
<p>All services provided by the Omea core can be accessed through the static 
properties of the <code> JetBrains.Omea.OpenAPI.Core</code> class, which are 
available all the time a plugin is running. For example, to create a new 
resource, the method <code> Core.ResourceStore.NewResource</code> is used. 
Complete documentation of interfaces available through the <code> Core</code> 
class can be found in the Open API documentation.</p>
<p>After you have compiled the plugin for the first time, you'll need to add it 
to the system registry, so that Omea will know that it should be loaded. On your 
test machine you can use the &quot;Add...&quot; button in the Omea Plugins options page to 
add a plugin, but it is better to create an installer for the plugin that will 
add it to the registry automatically. The list of Omea plugins is stored in the 
registry under <code> Software\JetBrains\Omea\Plugins</code> for Omea Pro and 
under <code> Software\JetBrains\Omea Reader\Plugins</code> for Omea Reader. The 
contents of these keys is scanned both for <code> HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE</code> and <code> HKEY_CURRENT_USER</code>; 
plugins from either key are loaded.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>

<h2>Defining Resource and Property Types</h2>
<p>In order to understand which resource and property types will be needed by 
the plugin, we need to decide on our requirements first. To keep the example 
simple, we will store only the minimum required information about each book.</p>
<p>Our plugin will allow the user to create, edit and view books. For every 
book, the user will be able to enter its name, authors, the year it was 
published and, optionally, its ISBN (which will serve as the unique identifier 
for the book). Every book can have several authors, and every person can be the 
author of several books.</p>
<p>To make the most use of the core features of Omea, it is recommended to reuse 
the resource and property types defined by the core and the standard plugins 
whenever it makes sense. In our example, we will need to create a new resource 
type to represent books (because that's the whole point of our plugin, after 
all). On the other hand, we do not need to create a separate resource type to 
represent book authors - we can reuse the standard <code> Contact</code> 
resource type to represent them. The openness of the Omea data model allows us 
to add any extra properties and links to <code> Contact</code> resources if we 
need to.</p>
<p>To represent the name of the book, we can also reuse an existing property 
type - <code> Name</code>, which is a string property type with no special 
features, and suits us just fine. We could represent the publication date of the 
book with the standard date property type <code> Date</code>, but it does not 
fit us quite well. It is usually not important to know the exact publication 
date of the book, and asking the user to enter that information will be an extra 
burden. Thus, we will create a new integer property type to represent the 
publication year. The ISBN will also be represented by a new string property 
type.</p>
<p>We will also define a new link type to represent the connection between a 
book and its authors. There is no inherent order for that connection, so we will 
not use a directed link type - the link will be completely symmetric.</p>
<p>To make sure the resource and property types defined by a third-party plugin 
do not conflict with the types defined by the Omea core or other third-party 
plugins, it is strongly recommended to use a prefix consisting of your company 
name and plugin name for every defined type. For example, our book resource type 
is called <code> JetBrains.Librarian.Book</code>, and the ISBN property type is <code> JetBrains.Librarian.ISBN</code>. 
The resource and property types defined by the Omea core do not have any dotted 
prefix. Display names are registered for the resource and property types, so 
that the user will see friendly-looking names, without any dotted prefixes.</p>
<p>The registration code for the resource and property types, along with the 
accessors for the registered property type IDs, is found in the classes 
<code> <a href="PropTypes.html">PropTypes</a></code> and <code> 
<a href="ResourceTypes.html">ResourceTypes</a></code>. Because the display name templates of some resource 
types may reference property types defined in the plugin, we register all 
property types before registering all resource types.</p>
<p>Note that the registration of resource and property types is completely 
separate - we do not need to tell Omea which properties we are going to use for 
the <code> Book</code> resource type. Any property can be applied to any 
resource type. However, to ensure data consistency, we register a <i>link 
restriction</i> specifying that the <code> BookAuthor</code> link of a book must 
point to a resource of type <code> Contact</code>. We could also specify 
restrictions on the link count (for example, specify that a book must have at 
least one author), but we want to allow the users to create books with unknown 
authors, so we don't restrict the link count.</p>
<p>The <i>unique restriction</i> on the <code> ISBN</code> property guarantees 
that the values of <code> ISBN</code> will be unique among all books. There can 
be any number of books for which the <code> ISBN</code> property is not defined, 
but if it is defined, there may exist no other <code> Book</code> resource with 
the same value of <code> ISBN</code>.</p>
<h2>Registering Actions</h2>
<p>Before we can proceed to implement any functionality for processing books, we 
need to be able to create <code> Book</code> resources. We could start by 
writing some code that will create book instances for testing, but in order to 
keep the sample shorter, we will develop the real user interface for creating 
books right away.</p>
<p>First of all, we need to create the class that will implement the book 
creation action. Invoking the action will open a nonmodal window where the user 
can enter the details of the book and click &quot;Save&quot; to complete the book creation 
process. The action does not depend on the selected resources or any other 
context, so we can make it available all the time.</p>
<p>All action classes need to implement the <code> IAction</code> interface, 
with two methods - <code> Execute</code>, which performs the action, and <code> Update</code>, 
which updates the state of the action. Because our action is always enabled, we 
don't need to do anything in the <code> Update</code> method. Therefore, we can 
inherit from <code> SimpleAction</code>, which provides a default empty 
implementation of <code> Update</code>, and only implement the <code> Execute</code> 
method. We will place the stub of the action implementation in the <code> NewBookAction</code> 
class.</p>
<p>Before proceeding to implement the action, let's register it so that we can 
see it in the Omea user interface. The &quot;File / New&quot; submenu of the main menu 
contains several commands for creating new resources, so this looks like a right 
place for our action.</p>
<p>
<img border="0" src="OmeaPluginNewBook.png" width="357" height="208" align="right">The placement of menu items, submenus and separators in the main menu is 
defined by <i>action groups</i>. An action group is a sequence of related 
actions which can be delimited from other action groups by a separator or placed 
in a submenu. The relative position of action groups, and of actions within an 
action group, is specified by <i>list anchors</i>. A list anchor (an instance of 
the <code> ListAnchor</code> class) specifies that an action or group should be 
placed first in the list (<code>ListAnchor.First</code>), last in the list (<code>ListAnchor.Last</code>), 
before or after another action or group.</p>
<p>We will add our action to the <code> FileNewActions</code> group, which is 
one of the action groups comprising the File / New submenu. We don't need any 
special positioning for the action, so we'll go with <code> ListAnchor.Last</code>.</p>
<p>If you run the plugin now, the &quot;Book...&quot; action will appear under &quot;File / 
New...&quot;, but nothing will happen when you click it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Creating and Editing Resources</h2>
<p>
<img border="0" src="OmeaPluginEditBook.png" width="299" height="168" align="right">To implement the book creation action, we will use the resource editing 
framework provided by Omea. The interface we will get as a result will be very 
similar to the interfaces for editing contacts and tasks in the standard Omea.</p>
<p>The standard resource editing window consists of two main parts: the frame 
with buttons and the validation label, provided by Omea, and the edit pane, 
which implements the resource type-specific editing interface. The edit pane is 
a UserControl derived from the <code> AbstractEditPane</code> base class. The 
frame is created when the resource to edit and the instance of the pane are 
passed to <code> Core.UIManager.OpenResourceEditWindow()</code>.</p>
<p>For common tasks, only two methods of <code> AbstractEditPane</code> need to 
be overridden. The method <code> EditResource()</code> shows the values of 
properties of the specified resource in the user interface controls. The method <code> 
<a href="BookEditPane_Save.html">Save()</a></code> 
saves the data from the controls to the resource properties.</p>
<p>An important point for development of resource edit windows is the 
requirement to perform all operations which create or modify resources in the <i>
resource thread</i>. This allows to serialize resource modification operations 
and greatly reduces the possibility of deadlocks and modification conflicts. The 
simplest way to marshal a resource write operation to the correct thread is to 
use the <code> ResourceProxy</code> class. An instance of the class is created 
in any thread, either attached to an existing resource or marked to create a new 
resource of the specified type. Then it accumulates the changes that need to be 
performed to the resource. The modifications are executed in the resource thread 
either synchronously (if the <code> EndUpdate()</code> method is used) or 
asynchronously (<code>EndUpdateAsync()</code>).</p>
<p>However, if you study the example code closely, you will note that <code> 
<a href="NewBookAction.html">NewBookAction</a></code> 
creates a new resource directly from the main (user interface) thread. This is 
actually not an error, because the method used to create the resource is <code> NewResourceTransient()</code>. 
That method creates a <i>transient</i> resource - a resource which exists only 
in the memory. If the resource needs to be actually saved (and not simply 
discarded for some reason), saving of the resource needs to be performed in the 
resource thread. This is done by running the <code> IResource.EndUpdate</code> 
method as a job in the resource thread, through <code> Core.ResourceAP.RunJob</code>. 
(The details of that can be found in the help file.)</p>
<p>In order to keep the user interface simple, we will implement editing the 
author list as a simple text string, containing a list of author names separated 
with commas. When the edit form is opened, we get all the links from a book to 
its authors and concatenate their names into a string which is shown in the edit 
box. The saving process is harder: we need to create the actual <code> Contact</code> 
resources to represent the authors and link them to the book resource. Thus, 
saving the book data will require modification of more than one resource, and it 
will be easier not to use <code> ResourceProxy</code> but to run the entire 
saving operation as a single method in the resource thread.</p>
<p>To create the contact resources, we use the system-provided <code> IContactManager</code> 
interface. It contains fairly complicated logic for parsing a single contact 
name string into components and for finding duplicate contacts, so we can simply 
give it a text string, and it will return an <code> IContact</code> (a wrapper 
around a contact resource) containing either a new contact or an existing 
contact with the same name. The only thing that remains for us to do is link the 
returned contact to the book resource.</p>

<h2>Viewing Resources</h2>
<p>
<img border="0" src="OmeaPluginAllBooks.png" width="257" height="170" align="right">Now we have the possibility to create books but there is no way to see the 
books we've created. Two things are required for us to see the books: a view 
where we can see the list of books and the UserControl to display the actual 
book contents.</p>
<p>To keep things simple, the initial version of the sample plugin will only 
have one view to show the books - the &quot;All Books&quot; view. We will demonstrate how 
to register a tab where the view appears and how to register the view itself.</p>
<p>The tab is registered with one simple call: 
<code>Core.TabManager.RegisterResourceTypeTab( &quot;Books&quot;, &quot;Books&quot;, _resBook, 20 );</code> 
We specify the ID and the display name of the tab, the type of resources shown 
in the tab and the index of the tab related to other tabs. The standard tabs, 
except for Tasks, have indexes between 0 and 10, and the Tasks tab has the index 
of 99. Thus, the index 20 places us after all the standard tabs but before 
Tasks.</p>
<p>After we register a tab, we get the standard Views and Categories pane and 
not much else. Books by default don't have any properties which are used for 
filtering by standard views (like date or annotation), so the views will 
initially be empty. However, we can easily add the view to display the list of 
all books.</p>
<p>In order for the &quot;Restore Default Views&quot; feature to work correctly for the 
plugin views, views should not be registered directly from the Register() or 
Startup() method of the plugin. Instead, the plugin should contain an 
<a href="ViewsConstructor.html">implementation</a> of the <code> IViewsConstructor</code> interface, register that implementation 
in the Register() method, and perform the views registration. </p>
<p>If you start the plugin now, you will see that the &quot;All Books&quot; view appears 
in the &quot;Books&quot; tab, and the books you create are shown in that view, but the 
preview pane is empty when you select a book resource. In order for the resource 
to be displayed, we need to provide a <i>display pane</i> implementation.</p>
<p>To understand how to implement the display pane, we need to understand the 
lifecycle of the display panes first. Each plugin which needs to display 
resources registers an implementation of <code> IResourceDisplayer</code> class, which 
basically serves as a factory for display panes. When Omea needs to display a 
resource, it locates a plugin which has registered a resource displayer for the 
required resource type and calls its <code> CreateDisplayPane()</code> method. The method 
returns a class which implements the <code> IDisplayPane</code> interface. Omea then embeds 
the control returned by <code> IDisplayPane.GetControl()</code> into the resource browser and 
calls <code> IDisplayPane.DisplayResource()</code> to get the resource displayed.</p>
<p>As the user switches between the resources of the same type, Omea continues 
to use the same display pane instance. It calls <code> EndDisplayResource()</code> before the 
user switches to a different resource and then <code> DisplayResource()</code> again to get 
the new resource displayed. If the user switches to a resource of a different 
type, the display pane is disposed. This is done by calling <code> EndDisplayResource()</code> 
for the last time, followed by a call to <code> DisposePane()</code>. The <code> DisposePane()</code> 
implementation usually disposes of the UserControl which was used to display the 
resource.</p>
<p>In our sample we will follow the common pattern and keep the 
<a href="IResourceDisplayer.html">IResourceDisplayer implementation</a> in the same class which implements <code> IPlugin</code>. 
The <code> IDisplayPane</code> interface will be implemented by the user control which is used 
to display the books.</p>
<p>The actual <code> IDisplayPane</code> implementation is pretty much trivial. The only 
method that contains real code is <code> 
<a href="BookDisplayPane_DisplayResource.html">DisplayResource()</a></code>. All the others would be 
needed if we wanted to implement more complex functionality - for example, 
selection and copy/paste, watching resource changes or highlighting search 
results.</p>
<h2>Making Resources Searchable</h2>

<p>Making it possible for the user to search the plugin resources requires two 
main tasks from the plugin developer:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Implementing and registering a class that will provide searchable text 
	for book resources;</li>
	<li>Requesting text indexing for the resources when they are changed.</li>
</ul>
<p>The main decisions that need to be made when implementing the text provider 
are: which of the resource properties should be searchable, and in what sections 
should the properties be divided. In our plugin, we want the user to be able to 
find a book if she enters its name, author or ISBN. The available sections can 
be seen in the Advanced Search dialog; the names of the predefined sections are 
available as constants in the <code> DocumentSection</code> class. 
<a href="TextProvider.html">Our implementation</a> will put the book name 
in the Subject/Heading section, the book authors in the Source/From section 
(which is also used for e-mail sender names, for example), and the ISBN will be 
treated as regular body text.</p>
<p>The indexing requests should be sent every time when the searchable content 
of the resource is changed. Our plugin has only one place where books can be 
changed, which is the <a href="BookEditPane_Save.html">Save handler</a> of the book edit pane. That's where we will 
put the indexing request, which is performed by a call to <code> Core.TextIndexManager.QueryIndexing</code>.</p>
<h2>Editing and Deleting Books</h2>
<p>Now we can create and view books, but there are two more operations that are 
critical for the plugin to be of any use: editing and deleting books. </p>
<p>Let's start with editing. We already have the main piece required to support 
editing: the edit pane. What we still need is the action to invoke the editing 
and the code in the <code> <a href="BookEditPane_EditResource.html">EditResource</a></code> 
method to fill the edit pane with the values of the properties from the 
edited book.</p>
<p>The <a href="EditBookAction.html">edit book action</a> is even simpler than the new book action. The only 
difference is that the edit book action is not always enabled - we need to know 
which book needs to be edited. Fortunately, there is a standard base class <code> ActionOnSingleResource</code> which covers one of our enabled requirements: one and 
only one resource must be selected. The other requirement - specifying that the 
selected resource must be a book - will be covered by specifying the resource 
type in the action registration calls. We will provide the user with two ways to 
invoke the action: double-clicking the book or right-clicking it and selecting 
&quot;Edit&quot; from the context menu.</p>
<p>The <a href="DeleteBookAction.html">delete book action</a> is also fairly simple: since the book does not have 
any complex connections, we can simply delete the book resource, and the system 
will handle deleting the links from it to other resources. One thing to note is 
that the action supports multiselection, so we need to loop through all selected 
resources instead of acting on the first one. Another is that, in order to 
improve UI responsiveness, the resources are deleted asynchronously. 
<code> ResourceProxy</code> is used to queue the deletions to the resource thread.</p>
<p>Registration of the delete book action is more interesting, though. The 
system already has several UI elements for the &quot;Delete&quot; action (a menu item in 
the Edit menu, a button on the toolbar, the Del key shortcut), and we want to 
apply all of them to our resource, instead of, for example, adding a new menu 
item &quot;Delete Book&quot; next to the &quot;Delete&quot; item. This is handled through <i>
composite actions</i>. A composite action is an action which contains a single 
UI presentation but multiple implementations provided by different plugins. The 
specific implementation to be executed is selected based on the action context 
(active tab, type of the selected resources and so on). The plugin registers an
<i>action component</i>, which references the composite ID (&quot;Delete&quot; in our 
case) and fits into all the composite actions (menu, keyboard and so on) which 
share the same composite ID.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>We have now seen all the basic steps required to implement a plugin which 
defines a new resource type. The features which have been implemented are: 
creating, viewing, editing, searching and deleting books. </p>
<p>There are many more things we could have covered, including sidebar pane 
registration, resource icons, workspace integration and more. We will leave all 
that for the second part of the tutorial. And for now - feel free to explore the 
API, and don't hesitate to ask questions by e-mail or in the Omea newsgroups!</p>
