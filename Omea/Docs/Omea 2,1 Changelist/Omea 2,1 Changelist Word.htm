	<h1>
		Omea Pro/Omea Reader 2.1 Changelog</h1>
	<h2>
		Installation</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>Omea Reader no more requires entering a license. Obvious blooper. First, it was
			useless for us (since we had no ability to process information obtained from license-related
			forms), besides it caused numerous mismatches in navigating users on our website.</li>
	</ul>
	<h2>
		Design</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>Two related products ? Pro and Reader are rebranded now. They have two different
			icons, more conforming to the corporate design style<br />
		<img width="115" height="84" src="image001.jpg"></li><li>They have different splash screens as well</li>
		<li>All icons have been reviewed. Shadows were removed from all icons, they became sharper
			and more distinctive, especially when small overlay icons are to be placed over
			them.</li>
	</ul>
	<h2>
		Outlook Plugin</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>Attachments are categorized along with their container emails. Before we could not
			see attachment resources staying on some category in ?Views and Categories? (?V&amp;C?
			hereinafter) pane.</li>
		<li>Empty AddressBooks (ABs) are also shown in the address books list.</li>
		<li>Possibility to save attachments over readonly files.</li>
		<li>Possibility to send attachments without preliminary saving to disk.</li>
		<li>New distinctive icon for mails with attached resources:<br />
		<img width="646" height="88" src="image002.jpg"></li><li>Outlook Meetings are now separate resources, definitely separated from ordinary
			mails. Omea can now open them in Outlook via Enter key or dbl-click, visually it
			is designated with a separate icon:<br />
		<img width="646" height="82" src="image003.jpg"></li><li>Email attached to other emails are now can be directly opened.</li>
		<li>Several options which automate assigning of categories to mails:<br />
		<img width="405" height="44" src="image004.gif"></li><li>Save email message(s) as text file</li>
		<li>Expiration rules for Outlook folders:<br />
		<img width="561" height="98" src="image005.jpg"></li><li>Fixed a bug with dragging a whole conversation containing attachments to some Outlook
			folder.</li>
		<li>NUMEROUS other bug fixes</li>
	</ul>
	<h2>
		NNTP Plugin</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>Options: ?Mark all read on exit? and ?Mark all read on Leave? for a newsgroup:<br />
		<img width="248" height="325" src="image006.jpg"></li><li>More strict logic is implemented for controlling the resources deletion. Given the
			News articles as the example:<br />
		<img width="578" height="203" src="image007.jpg"></li></ul>
	<p>
		What this generally means is that there will be no possibility fo a user to accidentally
		delete articles permanently ? either with the help of a rule or via keyboard.</p>
	<ul>
		<li>?Watch Conversation? ? possibility to create a special formatting for a [sub]thread,
			specifying its head:<br />

			to the specified [sub]thread:<br />

	</ul>
	<h2>
		Contacts Plugin</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>Correspondence is shown for ALL selected contacts in the Correspondents pane (previously
			only for the first one).</li>
	</ul>
	<h2>
		Filter Condition/Views/Rules</h2>
	<p>
		Features listed here are given alltogether instead of being distributed over the
		separate topics (by plugin).</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Separate conditions: ?From or To contact?, ?From contact? and ?To contact? (in addition
			to the existing one ?From, To or CC to contact?)</li>
		<li>RSS condition: ?Post is in the search feed?</li>
		<li>RSS condition: ?Post is a comment?</li>
		<li>RSS condition: ?Post is a comment from blog?s author?. This for example allows us
			to highlight the comments from the author:<br />
		<img width="408" height="378" src="image024.jpg"></li><li>News condition: ?Message is a reply in a flagged thread?.</li>
		<li>Two news conditions: ?Message has a reply? and ?Message is a reply?. As an example
			of usage I can show mine ? ?highlight all news articles which nobody has answered
			to yet?:<br />
		<img width="321" height="371" src="image025.jpg"></li><li>View ?Next Week? for Tasks</li>
		<li>We have a VERY special condition now: ?Contact has correspondence?. Condition is
			true for those contacts which have at least one related email, news article or feed
			post, including those which are deleted and may be found in the ?Deleted Resources?
			view. Follow up for this condition may be found in ?ToDo? section. This condition
			in the following rule:<br />
		<img width="306" height="348" src="image026.jpg"></li><li>
		highlighted me all garbage contacts. With the help of this condition I created a
		view and deleted approx a half of all contact resources ? I used an action ?Clean
		unused contact? which can be applied to the view. I suppose it is what most of us
		wanted for months.</li><li>
		Expiration rules now may be configured so that they do not touch categorized resources
		as well:<br />
		<img width="297" height="324" src="image027.jpg"></li></ul>

	</ul>
	<h2>
		FireFox Plugin</h2>
	<ul>
	<li>
		It works again!!! (with FF 1.5)</li>
	</ul>
	<h2>
		Text Index</h2>
	<ul>
	<li>
		New menu item (in Actions menu): Pause/Resume text indexing. This allows user to
		have more explicit control over the Omea (and the computer at whole) performance.</li>
	</ul>
	<h2>
		Optimizations</h2>
	<ul>
	<li>
		Reduced memory consumption</li><li>
		Reduced hard disk reading/writing</li><li>
		Improved multithreading and UI responsiveness</li><li>
		Reduced startup and closing time</li><li>
		Optimized for running on multiprocessor or hyper-threaded computers</li><li>
		Feed updating consumes less system resources</li><li>
		Faster import of ICQ history</li><li>
		Self-organizing database (in idle mode) for faster queries</li>
	</ul>
	<h2>
		Omea-Wide Changes</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>Opening a link in a new Web browser window is now performed asynchronously, so that
			Omea won?t hang if the Web browser or some other application is not responding at
			the moment.</li>
		<li>Drag?n?Drop reordering of resource trees: it?s now possible to change the order
			of items in the lists and trees with the mouse, as well as reset the user order
			back to lexicographical sorting.<br />
		<img width="247" height="142" src="DnD-Reorder.png"><br />
		<img width="452" height="432" src="ResetSortOrderContextMenu.png"></li></ul>
	<h2>
		Open Issues</h2>
	<ul>
	<li>
		Features and bug fixes covered in this section are to be finished before 2.1 release:</li><li>
		Task recurrence pattern. Currently most of the controls are in-place already, we
		need to complete the processing part.</li><li>
		Show view only in the predefined workspace(s). Currently user can specify that in
		the ?Edit View? dialog directly, but there is some logic behind to put it into ?Manage
		Workspaces? dialog:<br />
		<img width="367" height="265" src="image041.jpg"></li><li>
		Configure set of prefixes (like ?RE? or ?FW?) to be ignored when sorting by subject.</li><li>
		Reordering in the V&amp;C pane</li><li>
		Crashes in text index. We still have problems in reproducing this.</li><li>
		Incorrect parsing of URLs in emails and news articles.</li><li>
		Merging contacts</li><li>
		Tasks duplication when synchronizing with Outlook</li><li>
		Exceptions in Replies to news articles. Most of these exceptions are related to
		.Net 2.0 and the lack of testing under it.</li><li>
		Skipping RSS posts with equal description string</li><li>
		News articles encoding issues</li><li>
		Performance, performance, performance?</li><li>
		Bug fixes. Please do not warry if you did not find your most upleasant bug in the
		list above. There is always a chance that we will fix it.
