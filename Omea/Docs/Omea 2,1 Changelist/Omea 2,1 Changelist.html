		Omea Pro / Omea Reader 2.1 Changelog</h1>
	<h2>
		Installation</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>Omea Reader no more requires entering a license. Obvious blooper. First, it was
			useless for us (since we had no ability to process information obtained from license-related
			forms), besides it caused numerous mismatches in navigating users on our website.</li></ul>
	<h2>
		Design</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>Two related products – Pro and Reader are rebranded now. They have two different
			icons, more conforming to the corporate design style.<br />
			<center>
				<img src="Icons.png" /></center>
		</li>
		<li>They have different splash screens as well</li>
		<li>All icons have been reviewed. Shadows were removed from all icons, they became sharper
			and more distinctive, especially when small overlay icons are to be placed over
			them. </li>
	</ul>
