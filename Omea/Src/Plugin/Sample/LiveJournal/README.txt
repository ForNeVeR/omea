This sample plugin for Omea Pro 1.0, Omea Reader 1.0.2 and later versions
allows you to subscribe to the RSS feeds of all your LiveJournal friends
in one step. The authentication parameters for the feeds will be configured
automatically, so that you will be able to see friends-only posts in
their journals.

To install the plugin, unpack it to the Omea installation directory, go to
Tools | Options | Omea | Plugins, click on "Add..." and select the
LiveJournalPlugin.dll file. Then restart Omea.

To use the plugin, click on "Import LiveJournal friends as feeds..." in the File
menu, enter your LiveJournal user name and password, and specify the update
interval for feeds if desired.

The complete C# source code of the plugin is included. You may use portions of
the source code in your plugins.
