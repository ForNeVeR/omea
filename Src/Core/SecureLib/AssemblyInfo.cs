//  Thanks To
//  ~~~~~~~~~
//    We would like to thank the following people for their help with the security library:
//
//		Chris Hudel			[method implementation]
//		Jonni Faiga			[bugfix]
//		Michael J. Moore	[bugfix]
//		John Doty			[bugfix]
//		Hernan de Lahitte	[bugfix, method implementation]
//		Brandon				[bugfix]
//		Daryn Kiely			[bugfix]
//		Kevin Knoop			[method implementation, performance optimizations, bugfix]
//		Gabriele Zannoni	[method implementation]
//		Stefan Bernbo		[bugfix]

// Version information for an assembly consists of the following four values:
//
[assembly: AssemblyVersion("1.0.13.711")]

// In order to sign your assembly you must specify a key to use. Refer to the 
// Microsoft .NET Framework documentation for more information on assembly signing.
//
// Use the attributes below to control which key is used for signing. 
//
// Notes: 
//   (*) If no key is specified, the assembly is not signed.
//   (*) KeyName refers to a key that has been installed in the Crypto Service
//       Provider (CSP) on your machine. KeyFile refers to a file which contains
//       a key.
//   (*) If the KeyFile and the KeyName values are both specified, the 
//       following processing occurs:
//       (1) If the KeyName can be found in the CSP, that key is used.
//       (2) If the KeyName does not exist and the KeyFile does exist, the key 
//           in the KeyFile is installed into the CSP and used.
//   (*) In order to create a KeyFile, you can use the sn.exe (Strong Name) utility.
//       When specifying the KeyFile, the location of the KeyFile should be
//       relative to the project output directory which is
//       %Project Directory%\obj\<configuration>. For example, if your KeyFile is
//       located in the project directory, you would specify the AssemblyKeyFile 
//       attribute as [assembly: AssemblyKeyFile("..\\..\\mykey.snk")]
//   (*) Delay Signing is an advanced option - see the Microsoft .NET Framework
//       documentation for more information on this.
