This sample plugin for Omea Pro 1.0 and Omea Reader 1.0.2 allows you to
post the text of a specific Omea resource or the selected text in Omea
to OneNote. OneNote is part of the Microsoft Office 2003 suite. In order
for the plugin to work, you need to have OneNote 2003 SP1 installed.

To install the plugin, unpack it to the Omea installation directory, go to
Tools | Options | Omea | Plugins, click on "Add..." and select the
CategoryHotkeys.dll file. Then restart Omea.

To use the plugin, select any resource in Omea or a section of text within
a resource and select "Post to OneNote" from the Actions menu. The selected
text will be posted as a new page in the General notebook.

The complete C# source code of the plugin is included. You may use portions of
the source code in your plugins.
