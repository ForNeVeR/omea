The archive contains the sources of wvWare 1.0.0 adapted by JetBrains
for use in the OmniaMea project. The archive also includes the project
file for Visual Studio 2003 (Visual C++ 7.1) that we use to build
wvWare.exe.

The following external dependencies are required to build the project:

 - zlib 1.2.1 DLL
   http://www.zlib.net/zlib121-dll.zip
   (assumed to be installed in C:\Src\zlib)

 - libpng 1.2.5
   http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/png-mng/lpng125.zip?download
   (assumed to be installed in C:\Src\libpng-1.2.5, compiled using
   the Visual C++ project file included in the distribution)

 - libiconv 1.9.1
   http://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/libiconv/libiconv-1.9.1.tar.gz
   (assumed to be installed in C:\Src\libiconv-1.9.1, compiled as
   a static library using the NMAKE makefile included in the distribution:
   nmake -f Makefile.msvc MFLAGS=-MD NO_NLS=1
   )


The following changes have been made by JetBrains:
